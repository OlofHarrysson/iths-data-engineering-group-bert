    "title": "How an archeological approach can help leverage biased data in AI to improve medicine",
    "summary": "Computer science and bioethics professors argue that biased medical data should be viewed as informative artifacts rather than simply \"garbage in, garbage out.\" They suggest that a sociotechnical perspective is needed to address bias in AI models used in medical settings. Biased data should be seen as revealing historical and social factors that have led to inequities in healthcare. The authors recommend involving bioethicists and clinicians in the development of AI models and considering the impact of race-based correction. They also emphasize the importance of high-quality, ethically sourced datasets and the role of organizations like the National Institutes of Health in driving ethical practices. Treating biased datasets as artifacts can lead to a better understanding of context and the development of policies to eliminate bias.",
