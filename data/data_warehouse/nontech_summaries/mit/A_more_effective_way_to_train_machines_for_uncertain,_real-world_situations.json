    "title": "A more effective way to train machines for uncertain, real-world situations",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT and Technion have developed an algorithm that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to train machines more effectively. The algorithm dynamically determines when the machine should mimic a teacher and when it should explore on its own. By adapting the weighting of the two learning methods, the algorithm can achieve better results and faster learning. The researchers tested the approach in simulations and found that it outperformed methods that used only one type of learning. The algorithm could improve the training process for machines deployed in real-world situations, such as robots navigating unfamiliar environments.",
