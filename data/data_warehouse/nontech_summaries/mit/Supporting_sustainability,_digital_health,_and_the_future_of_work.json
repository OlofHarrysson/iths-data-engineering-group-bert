    "summary": "The MIT and Accenture Convergence Initiative for Industry and Technology has selected three new research projects to receive support. The projects aim to address complex societal needs through new insights in technology and innovation. The projects focus on sustainability, digital health, and the future of work. The first project aims to identify how industrial clusters can help companies transition to clean energy. The second project focuses on eliminating childhood obesity by creating a return-on-investment calculator for interventions. The third project looks at reshaping the future of work using AI algorithms to match applicants to jobs and assess skill training. These projects have the potential to make a significant impact and advance data-driven research in technology and industry convergence.",
