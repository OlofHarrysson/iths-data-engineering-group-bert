    "summary": "MIT Professor Jonathan How and his team have been developing a trajectory planning system that allows a fleet of drones to operate in the same airspace without colliding with each other. The system uses distributed robust planning algorithms to coordinate the drones and avoid collisions. One of the key challenges in multi-vehicle work is communication delays, so the team embedded a \"perception aware\" function in their system that allows each drone to gather new information about the other drones and alter its own trajectory accordingly. The algorithmic fix resulted in a 100% success rate in testing. The next step is to scale up the algorithms and test in larger spaces. The system has real-world implications for industries such as agriculture and defense, as it can lead to cost savings and increased efficiency. Professor How's research interests also include autonomous cars and aircraft. For autonomous cars, his team collects real-time data to track pedestrians and generate models to understand their behavior, enabling the cars to make better decisions. For aircraft, Professor How uses fast-to-query neural networks to quickly perform necessary computations on board the aircraft, reducing the time required to make decisions. He has worked closely with companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon to solve real-world problems.",
