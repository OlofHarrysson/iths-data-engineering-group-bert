    "title": "Autonomous innovations in an uncertain world",
    "summary": "MIT Professor Jonathan How and his team have developed a trajectory planning system that allows a fleet of drones to operate in the same airspace without colliding with each other. The system uses distributed robust planning algorithms to coordinate the drones and avoid collisions. The team has embedded a \"perception aware\" function in the system that allows each drone to gather new information about the other drones and alter its trajectory accordingly. The algorithm has a 100% success rate in avoiding collisions. The system has real-world implications for industries such as agriculture and defense. How has also been working on improving autonomous vehicles' ability to identify and track pedestrians, as well as developing real-time decision-making systems for aircraft.",
