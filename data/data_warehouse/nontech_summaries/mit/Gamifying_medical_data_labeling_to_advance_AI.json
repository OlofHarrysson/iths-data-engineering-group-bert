    "summary": "Centaur Labs, founded by MIT graduate Erik Duhaime, has developed a mobile app called DiagnosUs that gathers the opinions of medical experts on real-world scientific and biomedical data. Users of the app review images or audio clips related to medical conditions, and if their opinions are accurate, they are awarded small cash prizes. The opinions collected by Centaur Labs help train and improve the algorithms of medical AI companies. The app has tens of thousands of users, including medical students and professionals, who are able to improve their skills while contributing to the development of life-saving AI.",
