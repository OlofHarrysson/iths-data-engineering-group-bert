    "title": "Understanding viral justice",
    "summary": "Ruha Benjamin, a scholar who studies the social aspects of science, medicine, and technology, believes that justice can be contagious, just like a virus. In her book \"Viral Justice: How We Grow the World We Want,\" Benjamin argues that small actions and decisions can have exponential effects in promoting justice. She highlights examples of exclusion and discriminatory design, such as park benches with armrests that prevent people from lying down or sleeping. Benjamin also discusses the hidden biases and inequalities embedded in new technologies, calling for the recognition of these harms and the creation of alternatives. She emphasizes the power of collective action and cites initiatives like the Data for Black Lives movement and the Detroit Community Technology Project as examples of people demanding different rights and protections in the digital ecosystem. Benjamin's Ida B. Wells Just Data Lab aims to develop a critical and creative approach to data that addresses racial inequality. She believes that by reimagining technology and weaving new patterns, practices, and politics, we can overcome the vast problems of inequity in society.",
