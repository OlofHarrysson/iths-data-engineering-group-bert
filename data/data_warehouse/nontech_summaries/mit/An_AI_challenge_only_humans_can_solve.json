    "title": "An AI challenge only humans can solve",
    "summary": "MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson argue in their new book, \"Power and Progress: Our 1000-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity,\" that the current path of artificial intelligence (AI) is detrimental to both the economy and democracy. They believe that AI should be designed to make machines useful to people rather than replacing them, and that it should focus on creating marginal productivity gains that compel firms to hire more workers. They also advocate for policy responses such as data ownership for internet users, tax reform, and government support for high-tech research.",
