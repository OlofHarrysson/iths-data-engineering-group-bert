    "title": "Study finds ChatGPT boosts worker productivity for some writing tasks",
    "summary": "A study from MIT has found that generative AI, specifically the chatbot ChatGPT, can increase productivity for workers in tasks such as writing cover letters and emails. The study involved 453 professionals who were given writing tasks specific to their occupation, with half of them using ChatGPT. The results showed that those who used ChatGPT completed tasks faster and produced higher-quality output. However, the study also acknowledged limitations, such as the lack of contextual knowledge and the need for fact-checking. The researchers believe that generative AI has potential but more research is needed to understand its broader impact on the economy and society.",
