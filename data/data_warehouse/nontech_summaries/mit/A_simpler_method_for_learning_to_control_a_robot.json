    "title": "A simpler method for learning to control a robot",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT and Stanford University have developed a machine-learning approach that could improve the control of robots, such as drones and autonomous vehicles, in dynamic environments. The approach incorporates structure from control theory into the learning process, enabling the creation of more effective controllers. The technique also requires less data than other approaches, making it more efficient in rapidly changing conditions. The researchers believe their approach could be applied to a range of dynamical systems, from robotic arms to spacecraft. The research was supported by NASA and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.",
