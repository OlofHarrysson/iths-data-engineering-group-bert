    "title": "AI models are powerful, but are they biologically plausible?",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and Harvard Medical School have proposed a hypothesis that astrocytes, non-neuronal cells in the brain, could perform the same core computation as a transformer, a powerful type of artificial neural network. The researchers developed a mathematical model that shows how astrocytes and neurons could be used together to build a biologically plausible transformer. This hypothesis could help explain the success of transformers in machine learning and could also spark further research into how the human brain works.",
