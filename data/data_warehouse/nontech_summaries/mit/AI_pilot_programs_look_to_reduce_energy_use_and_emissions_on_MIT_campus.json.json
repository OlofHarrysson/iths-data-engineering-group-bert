    "title": "AI pilot programs look to reduce energy use and emissions on MIT campus",
    "summary": "MIT researchers are using artificial intelligence (AI) to develop smart building controls that can dynamically manage the heating and cooling of an entire campus. By collecting and synthesizing data, the AI system can respond in real-time to factors such as occupancy fluctuations, weather forecasts, and the carbon intensity of the grid. The goal is to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions while maintaining thermal comfort for occupants. The pilot project is currently focused on six classrooms, with plans to expand to lab spaces and eventually the entire building. The researchers estimate significant energy savings and hope to scale up the technology to other rooms and buildings on campus.",
