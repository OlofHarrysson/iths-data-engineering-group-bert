    "title": "Machine-learning system based on light could yield more powerful, efficient large language models",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed a new system that could significantly enhance the power and energy efficiency of machine-learning programs. The system, described in a paper published in Nature Photonics, uses light instead of electrons to perform computations, resulting in a more than 100-fold improvement in energy efficiency and a 25-fold improvement in compute density compared to state-of-the-art digital computers. The researchers believe that this technology could enable large-scale optoelectronic processors that can run machine-learning tasks on small devices like cellphones. The components of the system can be created using existing fabrication processes, making it scalable for commercial use in the near future. The researchers have filed for a patent on the technology, which was sponsored by various organizations including the U.S. Army Research Office and the National Science Foundation.",
