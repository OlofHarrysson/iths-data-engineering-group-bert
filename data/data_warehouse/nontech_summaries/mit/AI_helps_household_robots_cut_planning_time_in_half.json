    "title": "AI helps household robots cut planning time in half",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a system called PIGINet that enhances the problem-solving capabilities of household robots. PIGINet uses machine learning to reduce the time it takes for robots to plan and execute tasks. Typically, robots go through an iterative process of task planning, considering all possible actions, which can be inefficient and time-consuming. PIGINet eliminates task plans that can't satisfy collision-free requirements, reducing planning time by 50-80 percent. It uses a neural network that takes in plans, images of the environment, and initial and goal states to predict the feasibility of task plans. The researchers created simulated environments to test PIGINet and found that it significantly reduced planning time. PIGINet's use of multimodal embeddings and image data allows for better representation and understanding of complex geometric relationships. The researchers aim to further refine PIGINet to suggest alternate task plans and revolutionize the way robots are trained and applied in different environments.",
