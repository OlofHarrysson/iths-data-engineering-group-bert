    "title": "AI helps household robots cut planning time in half",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a system called PIGINet that uses machine learning to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of household robots. PIGINet eliminates task plans that can't satisfy collision-free requirements, reducing planning time by 50-80 percent. The system uses a neural network that takes in plans, images, goals, and initial facts to predict the feasibility of task plans. PIGINet significantly reduces planning time in both simple and complex scenarios. The researchers aim to further refine PIGINet to suggest alternate task plans and revolutionize the way robots are trained and applied in various environments.",
