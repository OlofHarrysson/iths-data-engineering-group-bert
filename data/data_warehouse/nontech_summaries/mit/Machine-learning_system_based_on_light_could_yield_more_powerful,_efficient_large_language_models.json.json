    "title": "Machine-learning system based on light could yield more powerful, efficient large language models",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed a new system that could significantly improve the power and energy efficiency of machine-learning programs. The system, which uses light instead of electrons to perform computations, demonstrated a 100-fold improvement in energy efficiency and a 25-fold improvement in compute density compared to state-of-the-art digital computers. The researchers believe that this technology could enable large-scale optoelectronic processors in the future, allowing small devices like cellphones to run programs that currently require large data centers. The system could also pave the way for machine-learning models that are currently economically unviable.",
