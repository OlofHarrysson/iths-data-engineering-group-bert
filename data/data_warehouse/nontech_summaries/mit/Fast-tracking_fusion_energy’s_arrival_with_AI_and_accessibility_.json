    "title": "Fast-tracking fusion energy\u2019s arrival with AI and accessibility ",
    "summary": "The US Department of Energy (DoE) has announced funding for a project led by researchers at MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) to integrate fusion data into a system that can be read by AI-powered tools. The project aims to create a holistic fusion data platform that offers unprecedented access for researchers and encourages diverse participation in fusion and data science. The platform will address barriers to participation for women and disadvantaged groups and adhere to FAIR (Findable, Interoperable, Accessible, Reusable) and Open Science principles. The project aligns with the International Atomic Energy Agency's \"AI for Fusion\" Coordinated Research Project.",
