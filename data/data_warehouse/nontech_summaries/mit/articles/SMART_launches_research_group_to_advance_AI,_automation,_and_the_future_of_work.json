    "summary": "The Singapore MIT-Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) has launched a new interdisciplinary research group called Mens, Manus and Machina: How AI Empowers People, Institutions and the City in Singapore (M3S). The group aims to tackle social and institutional challenges related to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies. M3S will focus on designing inclusive and innovative solutions that empower individuals, institutions, and cities. The project is supported by a multimillion-dollar grant from the National Research Foundation of Singapore. The team consists of 17 professors from MIT and institutions in Singapore, and will explore the relationship between human capabilities, emerging technologies, and societal structures. The research conducted by M3S will contribute to Singapore's AI ecosystem and focus on the human-machine relationship. The group will address key issues such as physical and digital interfaces between humans and machines, machine learning fundamentals, and the implications of AI for human and social capital development. The goal is to advance AI technology in a way that benefits society and enhances human potential.",
