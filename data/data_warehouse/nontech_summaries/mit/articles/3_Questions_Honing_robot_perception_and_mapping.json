    "title": "3 Questions: Honing robot perception and mapping",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT's Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) have developed an open-source library called Kimera that allows robots to construct real-time 3D maps of their environment and label objects. The team, led by Luca Carlone and Jonathan How, has also introduced Kimera-Multi, a system that enables multiple robots to communicate and create a unified map. The researchers believe that scaling up the system to include more robots offers advantages such as consistency and redundancy. They have conducted experiments on the MIT campus where robots exchange information to improve their maps. The challenge is to reach a consensus between robots without exchanging too much data. The researchers are working on developing a more sophisticated understanding of the environment, including hierarchical representations and complex relationships between objects. The technology has potential applications in autonomous vehicles, search and rescue missions, mapping buildings after disasters, and flexible factories where robots need to cooperate with humans in less structured environments.",
