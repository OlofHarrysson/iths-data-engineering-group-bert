    "title": "How an \u201cAI-tocracy\u201d emerges",
    "summary": "A new study conducted by researchers from MIT and Harvard University suggests that authoritarian regimes, such as China, can use AI-driven facial recognition technology to suppress dissent and strengthen their political control. The study found that in regions of China with more unrest, the government increased its procurement of facial recognition AI, leading to the development of better AI-based tools. The researchers call this cycle an \"AI-tocracy,\" where the deployment of AI technology quells dissent and stimulates further innovation. The study analyzed data on political unrest in China and government procurement contracts for facial recognition technology. It also found that the use of facial recognition technology effectively reduced protest levels. Additionally, the study revealed that the government's increased demand for AI technology drove the country's tech sector forward, leading to greater innovation. The findings highlight how autocratic governments can harness technological advances to enhance their political power and generate economic growth. However, the study does not contradict previous research that shows democratic institutions promote greater economic growth over time. The researchers are also examining the global export of facial recognition technology by China, which could contribute to government repression worldwide.",
