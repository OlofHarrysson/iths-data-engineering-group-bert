    "title": "Envisioning the future of computing",
    "summary": "MIT recently held an essay contest called the Envisioning the Future of Computing Prize, in which students were asked to imagine how advances in computing could transform society. The competition received nearly 60 submissions from students majoring in various fields, including mathematics, philosophy, electrical engineering, computer science, and more. The essays explored a range of ideas, such as using computing technologies to address climate change and improve healthcare. Some students proposed specific technologies, such as digital twins for navigating online information or AI-powered storytelling films for personal understanding. The winning entry, written by Robert Cunningham, discussed the implications of a personalized language model that predicts an individual's writing based on their past texts and emails. The other finalists explored topics like using reinforcement learning to transform human interactions with AI and developing automatic fact checkers to combat misinformation. The competition aimed to encourage students to think about the societal benefits and costs of the technologies they are developing.",
