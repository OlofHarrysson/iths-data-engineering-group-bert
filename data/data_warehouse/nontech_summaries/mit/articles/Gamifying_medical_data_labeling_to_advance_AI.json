    "title": "Gamifying medical data labeling to advance AI",
    "summary": "Erik Duhaime, a former MIT student, founded Centaur Labs, a company that created a mobile app called DiagnosUs. The app gathers the opinions of medical experts on real-world scientific and biomedical data. Users review images or audio clips related to medical conditions and if their opinions are accurate, they are awarded small cash prizes. These opinions help medical AI companies improve their algorithms. The app combines the desire of medical experts to improve their skills with the need for well-labeled medical data by AI companies. The approach is based on the concept of collective intelligence, where the opinions of a group of people can be more accurate than those of individuals. Centaur Labs has found that the best performers on their app come from surprising places, such as medical students in Ghana. The company believes that their platform will be used not only to train AI algorithms but also to monitor and provide feedback on their outputs. They see a future where humans and AI algorithms work together in various tasks throughout the economy.",
