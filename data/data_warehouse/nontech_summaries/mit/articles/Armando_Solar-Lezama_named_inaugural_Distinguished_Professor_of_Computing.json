    "summary": "Armando Solar-Lezama has been named the inaugural Distinguished Professor of Computing at the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing. This position was generously endowed by Professor Jae S. Lim of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Solar-Lezama is being recognized for his outstanding contributions to MIT and the scientific community. He is a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and leads the Computer-Aided Programming Group at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. His research focuses on program synthesis, which combines programming systems and artificial intelligence. Solar-Lezama is particularly interested in software synthesis and its applications to areas such as high-performance computing. He developed a language called Sketch during his graduate studies at the University of California at Berkeley, which treats program synthesis as a search problem. Program synthesis research has since become a prominent field.",
