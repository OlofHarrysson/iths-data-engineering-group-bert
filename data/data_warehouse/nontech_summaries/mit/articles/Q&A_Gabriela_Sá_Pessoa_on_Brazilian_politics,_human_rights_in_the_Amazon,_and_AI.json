    "title": "Q&A: Gabriela S\u00e1 Pessoa on Brazilian politics, human rights in the Amazon, and AI",
    "summary": "Gabriela S\u00e1 Pessoa is a journalist from Brazil who is currently a fellow at MIT. She focuses on reporting on human rights and environmental issues, particularly in the Amazon. She believes that it is important to report on this topic because everyone is complicit in the destruction of the rainforest, and it is our responsibility to be aware of it and take action. She also discusses the recent changes in Brazilian politics with the new Lula administration, highlighting both positive and negative developments in environmental policy. S\u00e1 Pessoa is learning a lot from her fellowship at MIT, particularly about incorporating a scientific approach into her journalism and the potential of artificial intelligence. After MIT, she will be interning at The New York Times and hopes to continue her research on carbon credit markets. She is inspired to continue studying and potentially return to academia in the future.",
