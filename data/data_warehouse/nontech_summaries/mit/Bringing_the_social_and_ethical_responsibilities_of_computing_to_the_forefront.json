The symposium brought together social scientists, humanists, computer scientists, and engineers to discuss the opportunities and challenges presented by the broad applicability of algorithms and AI in various aspects of society. The event featured panels and sessions on topics such as fair computing, equitable health, and the interaction between algorithms and humans. It also included a poster session where students showcased their research on topics like quantum ethics and AI collusion. The symposium emphasized the need for responsible technology development and deployment and highlighted the importance of educating students to consider the social impact of the technologies they develop. The event concluded with discussions among faculty, students, and researchers on the issues raised throughout the day.",
