    "title": "A new dataset of Arctic images will spur artificial intelligence research",
    "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Healy is capturing images of the Arctic during its voyage across the North Pole to study the rapidly changing region. Researchers from Lincoln Laboratory installed a camera system on the Healy to develop artificial intelligence tools that can analyze Arctic imagery. The dataset will help mariners navigate safely, protect national security, and understand the changing climate, wildlife, and geography of the Arctic. The dataset will be publicly released, allowing the wider research community to develop better tools for operating in the Arctic.",
