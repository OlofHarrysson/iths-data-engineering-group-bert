    "title": "MIT scientists build a system that can generate AI models for biology research",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed an automated machine-learning system called BioAutoMATED that can select and build appropriate models for biological datasets. The system also handles the laborious task of data preprocessing, reducing the time required from weeks to just a few hours. BioAutoMATED is particularly useful for biology-centric labs that may not have access to machine-learning expertise. The open-source code for the system is publicly available, and the researchers hope to collaborate with the biological research community to further improve the tool.",
