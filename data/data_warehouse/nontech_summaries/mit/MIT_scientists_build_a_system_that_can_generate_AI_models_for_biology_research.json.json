    "title": "MIT scientists build a system that can generate AI models for biology research",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed an automated machine-learning system called BioAutoMATED that can select and build appropriate models for biological datasets, eliminating the need for machine-learning expertise. The system also handles data preprocessing, reducing the time required from weeks to just a few hours. BioAutoMATED focuses on biological sequences, such as DNA and proteins, and offers a larger search space by incorporating multiple tools. The open-source code is publicly available, and the researchers hope to collaborate with the biological research community to further improve the system.",
