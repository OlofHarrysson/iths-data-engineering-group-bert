    "title": "3 Questions: Honing robot perception and mapping",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed an open-source library called Kimera that allows robots to construct real-time 3D maps of their environment and label objects. The team has now introduced Kimera-Multi, which enables multiple robots to communicate and create a unified map. The system aims to provide consistency and redundancy, allowing robots to work together to complete tasks more efficiently. The researchers envision applications in search and rescue missions, mapping after natural disasters, and flexible factory environments. They also suggest that autonomous vehicles could benefit from sharing information and improving mapping models.",
