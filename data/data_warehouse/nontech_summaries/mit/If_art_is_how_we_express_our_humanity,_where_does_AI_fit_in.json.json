    "title": "If art is how we express our humanity, where does AI fit in?",
    "summary": "A group of researchers from MIT and other organizations have published a commentary article in Science, highlighting the immediate impact of generative AI on creative work and society. The researchers emphasize the need for discussions about the human role in creative production and the potential dangers of AI, such as disinformation and job displacement. They also identify gaps in research, including the need for transparency in the generative process and the consideration of legal aspects, labor economics, and the media ecosystem. The researchers hope to start a conversation and build a roadmap for understanding the implications of AI technology.",
