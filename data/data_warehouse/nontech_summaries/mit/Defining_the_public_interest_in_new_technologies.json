    "summary": "The Public Interest Technologist (TPIT) is an online publication launched by MIT to encourage technologists to address the ethical and moral dilemmas associated with new technologies. The publication aims to define and discuss the social responsibilities of individuals involved in designing, implementing, and evaluating technologies. It seeks to foster conversations about the public interest in technology and how to ensure that the benefits of new technologies uplift marginalized populations. TPIT is part of a coalition of universities focused on public interest technology and invites the MIT community to contribute to the discussion.",
