    "title": "Jackson Jewett wants to design buildings that use less concrete",
    "summary": "Jackson Jewett, a former biking tour guide in U.S. National Parks, has transitioned to pursuing a PhD in civil and environmental engineering at MIT. Jewett's research focuses on using topology optimization algorithms to design building-scale concrete structures that use less material, thereby reducing carbon emissions in the construction industry. He aims to implement his ideas practically and hopes to inspire others through his teaching assistant role at MIT. Jewett plans to pursue a career in academia after completing his program in 2025. He also emphasizes the importance of mental health resources in navigating the pressures of academia.",
