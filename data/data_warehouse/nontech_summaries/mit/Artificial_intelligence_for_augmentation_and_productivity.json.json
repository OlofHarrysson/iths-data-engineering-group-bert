    "title": "Artificial intelligence for augmentation and productivity",
    "summary": "The MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing has awarded seed grants to seven projects that aim to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction can enhance modern workspaces for better management and productivity. The interdisciplinary projects, funded by Dropbox Inc., will bring together researchers from computing, social sciences, and management. The projects include implementing Vannevar Bush's vision of the Memex using large language models, simulating social scenarios with AI agents, and studying the impact of AI on skill acquisition and productivity. Other projects focus on generative AI in hospitals, democratizing programming, AI-augmented onboarding and support, and AI-augmented management.",
