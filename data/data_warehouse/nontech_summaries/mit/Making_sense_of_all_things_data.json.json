    "summary": "Data is a valuable resource for businesses, but many struggle to make sense of it due to the sheer volume and complexity. MIT's Geospatial Data Center is helping industries and executives navigate this challenge by assisting them in transforming their operations to effectively use their data. This transformation requires reimagining data storage and democratizing access to it. Additionally, the integration of IoT, AI, the cloud, and security is crucial, and blockchain technology offers new opportunities for efficiency and productivity. Examples of blockchain's potential include streamlining patient identity recognition in hospitals and enabling smallholder farmers to access loans. Overall, digital transformation through data utilization can lead to better decision-making and increased profitability for businesses.",
