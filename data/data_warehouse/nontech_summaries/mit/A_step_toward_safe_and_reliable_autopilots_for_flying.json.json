    "title": "A step toward safe and reliable autopilots for flying",
    "summary": "MIT researchers have developed a new machine-learning technique that can solve complex stabilize-avoid problems better than existing methods. The technique, which combines constrained optimization and deep reinforcement learning, allows an autonomous agent to reach and stabilize within its goal region while avoiding obstacles. The researchers tested their approach by successfully piloting a simulated jet aircraft through a narrow corridor without crashing. This technique could be applied to designing controllers for highly dynamic robots or as part of larger systems for autonomous vehicles. The researchers aim to enhance the technique to account for uncertainty and test it on hardware.",
