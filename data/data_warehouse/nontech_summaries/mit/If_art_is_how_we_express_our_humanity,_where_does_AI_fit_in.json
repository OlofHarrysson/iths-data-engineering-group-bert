    "title": "If art is how we express our humanity, where does AI fit in?",
    "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic lately, with debates about its potential benefits and risks. However, amidst these discussions, it is important to focus on the AI technologies that are already available today. One such technology is generative AI, which can create content like text, images, audio, and video. Researchers from MIT and other organizations have published a commentary article in Science, highlighting the immediate impact of generative AI on creative work and society. They emphasize the need to understand the role of humans in the creative process and address concerns such as job displacement, disinformation, and changes to legal structures and culture. The researchers also point out the gaps in research around generative AI and art, including the need to design transparent interfaces and systems, consider the impact on aesthetics and culture, address issues of ownership and credit, understand the effects on labor economics and creativity, and safeguard the media ecosystem against AI-generated misinformation. The goal of the paper is to start a conversation and build a roadmap for understanding and responsibly using generative AI. The researchers believe that artists, who have been exploring AI art for years, can play a crucial role in shaping this discussion and ensuring the beneficial use of AI technologies.",
