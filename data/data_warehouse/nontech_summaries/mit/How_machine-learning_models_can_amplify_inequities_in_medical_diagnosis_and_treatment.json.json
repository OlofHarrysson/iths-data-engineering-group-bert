    "title": "How machine-learning models can amplify inequities in medical diagnosis and treatment",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT have identified four types of biases that can arise in machine learning models used in healthcare. These biases, known as subpopulation shifts, can lead to disparities in medical diagnosis and treatment. The researchers have developed a framework to understand these biases and are working towards developing more equitable models. They have also found that improving certain layers of the neural network can reduce some biases, but attribute generalization remains a challenge. The ultimate goal is to achieve fairness in healthcare for all populations.",
