    "title": "Defining the public interest in new technologies",
    "summary": "The emergence of disruptive technologies, such as advanced artificial intelligence systems, is changing the way we work, live, and play. It is important for academics, practitioners, innovators, and entrepreneurs to focus on ensuring that the benefits of these technologies uplift marginalized populations. Professional training is needed to address the ethical and moral dilemmas associated with new technologies. Creators of new technologies have a responsibility to consider the potential adverse societal consequences. Public interest technology is an emerging field that aims to shift the focus from the technologies to the technologists, emphasizing responsible development. MIT's Public Interest Technologist (TPIT) publication seeks to define and discuss the social responsibilities of technologists and foster conversations about public interest technology. The TPIT editorial team invites the MIT community to contribute to the discussion and attend the PIT-UN annual meeting at Boston University.",
