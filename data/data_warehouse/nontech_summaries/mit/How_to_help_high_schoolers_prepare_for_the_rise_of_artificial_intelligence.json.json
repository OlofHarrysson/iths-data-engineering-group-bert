    "title": "How to help high schoolers prepare for the rise of artificial intelligence",
    "summary": "The MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health (Jameel Clinic) recently held its inaugural summer program, aimed at educating high school students about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. The program, which was made possible by a generous donation, accepted 51 students from diverse backgrounds and offered courses such as \"Intro to Python\" and \"Intro to Clinical AI.\" The students also had the opportunity to visit local institutions and hear from MIT faculty members about their experiences in the field. The program aimed to inspire and open new opportunities for the students, many of whom come from under-resourced backgrounds. The students were assigned AI tools used in clinical settings or drug discovery for their final group project presentations, where they had to explain the tools and their potential benefits and risks. Overall, the program was successful in exposing the students to the intersection of computer science and medicine and inspiring them to pursue careers in the field.",
