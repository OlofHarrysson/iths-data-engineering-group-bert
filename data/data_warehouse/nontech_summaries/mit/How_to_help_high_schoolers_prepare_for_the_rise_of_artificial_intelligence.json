    "title": "How to help high schoolers prepare for the rise of artificial intelligence",
    "summary": "The MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health recently held its inaugural summer program, aimed at educating high school students about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. The program, which was made possible by a generous donation, accepted 51 students from diverse backgrounds and offered courses such as \"Intro to Python,\" \"Intro to Clinical AI,\" and \"Intro to Drug Discovery.\" The students also had the opportunity to visit local institutions and hear from MIT faculty members about their personal journeys in the field of AI and medicine. The program aimed to inspire and open new opportunities for the students, many of whom come from under-resourced backgrounds. The students worked on group projects, where they were assigned AI tools used in clinical settings or drug discovery and had to explain their assigned tool and its potential benefits and risks to a target audience. Overall, the program was a success, with students feeling inspired and gaining clarity about their future career paths.",
