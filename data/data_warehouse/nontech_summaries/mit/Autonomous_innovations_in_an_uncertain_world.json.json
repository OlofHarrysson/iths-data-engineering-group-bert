    "summary": "MIT Professor Jonathan How and his team have been developing a trajectory planning system that allows a fleet of drones to operate in the same airspace without colliding with each other. They have embedded a \"perception aware\" function in their system that allows a vehicle to use onboard sensors to gather new information about other vehicles and alter its own planned trajectory. The team has achieved a 100 percent success rate in collision-free flights among their group of drones. How is also working on improving the ability of autonomous vehicles to identify and track pedestrians, as well as pushing the boundaries of real-time decision-making for aircraft. He has collaborated with companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon to solve real-world problems.",
