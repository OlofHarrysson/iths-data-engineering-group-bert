    "title": "AI model can help determine where a patient\u2019s cancer arose",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have developed a computational model that uses machine learning to predict the origin of cancerous tumours. The model analyses the sequence of around 400 genes and can accurately classify at least 40% of tumours of unknown origin. This could enable more patients to receive genomically guided, targeted treatments based on where their cancer originated. The researchers hope to expand the model to include other types of data, such as pathology and radiology images, to provide a more comprehensive prediction.",
