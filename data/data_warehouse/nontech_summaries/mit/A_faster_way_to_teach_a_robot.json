    "title": "A faster way to teach a robot",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT, New York University, and the University of California at Berkeley have developed a framework that enables humans to quickly teach robots new tasks with minimal effort. When a robot fails at a task, the system generates counterfactual explanations that describe what needed to change for the robot to succeed. The system then asks the human for feedback on why the robot failed and uses this feedback to fine-tune the robot. The researchers found that robots trained with this framework performed better and required less time from humans. This framework could help robots learn faster in new environments and perform daily tasks efficiently.",
