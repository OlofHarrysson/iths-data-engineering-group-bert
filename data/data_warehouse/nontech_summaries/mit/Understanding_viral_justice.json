    "title": "Understanding viral justice",
    "summary": "In her book \"Viral Justice: How We Grow the World We Want,\" scholar Ruha Benjamin argues that justice can be contagious, just like a virus. She emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing the ways exclusion is built into our daily lives. Benjamin gives examples of discriminatory design, such as park benches with armrests that prevent people from lying down or sleeping. She also highlights the hidden biases in new technologies, such as facial recognition and predictive software. Benjamin calls this combination of bias and perceived objectivity \"the New Jim Code.\" However, she also encourages individuals to create alternatives and reimagine technology and society. Benjamin mentions initiatives like the Data for Black Lives movement and the Detroit Community Technology Project as examples of people demanding different rights and protections. She founded the Ida B. Wells Just Data Lab, which aims to develop a critical and creative approach to data that addresses racial inequality. Benjamin believes that by recognizing and challenging inequities, we can weave new patterns, practices, and politics that undo systemic problems.",
