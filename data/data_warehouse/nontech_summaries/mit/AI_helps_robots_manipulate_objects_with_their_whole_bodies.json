    "title": "AI helps robots manipulate objects with their whole bodies",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed a method to simplify contact-rich manipulation planning for robots. By using an AI technique called smoothing, the researchers were able to summarize many potential contact events into a smaller number of decisions, enabling a simple algorithm to quickly identify an effective manipulation plan for the robot. This method could potentially enable smaller, mobile robots to manipulate objects with their entire arms or bodies, reducing energy consumption and costs. It could also be useful for robots on exploration missions, allowing them to adapt quickly to their environment using only an onboard computer.",
