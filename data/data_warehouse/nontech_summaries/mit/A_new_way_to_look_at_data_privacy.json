    "title": "A new way to look at data privacy",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed a technique called Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Privacy that allows machine learning models to protect sensitive data while maintaining accuracy. The technique adds noise to the model to prevent adversaries from extracting the original data, but the challenge is to add the smallest amount of noise possible without compromising privacy. The PAC Privacy algorithm automatically determines the optimal amount of noise based on the uncertainty or entropy of the original data. This approach requires less noise compared to other methods, making it more practical for real-world applications.",
