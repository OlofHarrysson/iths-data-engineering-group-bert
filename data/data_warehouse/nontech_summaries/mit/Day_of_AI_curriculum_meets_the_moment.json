    "summary": "MIT Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education (RAISE) recently held its second annual Day of AI, which included two flagship events. The first event, held at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate in Boston, focused on human rights and data policy and was streamed worldwide. The second event was a student workshop held at Dearborn STEM Academy in collaboration with Amazon Future Engineer. Participation in the Day of AI has more than doubled since its inaugural year, with over 8,000 registrations from all 50 U.S. states and 108 countries in 2023.\n\nThe Day of AI is a free curriculum designed by researchers at MIT RAISE to teach kids of all ages and backgrounds the basics and responsible use of artificial intelligence. This year, educators had the flexibility to run the curriculum at any time and in any increments they chose. The curriculum included five new modules covering topics such as AI in schools, teachable machines, AI and social media, and data science. Modules for early elementary students were also introduced in collaboration with the International Society for Technology in Education.\n\nThe event speakers emphasized the importance of responsible AI use and the need to align AI with community values. They discussed how AI can be used to improve city life in equitable and accessible ways and highlighted the importance of inclusive AI development to mitigate biases. The event also included discussions on government policies that can influence the development and use of AI, as well as activities where students explored the potential benefits and risks of AI in various domains.\n\nAt Dearborn STEM Academy, students had the opportunity to work with Amazon Future Engineer to learn about voice AI and code basic commands for Alexa using MIT App Inventor. The event aimed to expose students to different experiences and empower them to shape the use of AI in society.\n\nThe Day of AI program was not only adopted globally but also adapted by Australian educators to suit their region-specific curriculum. Day of AI Australia reached 85,000 students at over 400 secondary schools, sparking curiosity in the next generation of AI experts.\n\nOverall, the Day of AI provides K-12 students with the opportunity to learn about AI and shape the future of digital technology. The event emphasizes responsible AI use and encourages students to be actively involved in discussions and decision-making regarding AI.",
