    "title": "Fast-tracking fusion energy\u2019s arrival with AI and accessibility ",
    "summary": "The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) has provided funding for a project led by researchers at MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) to integrate fusion data into an AI-powered system. The project aims to create a holistic fusion data platform that offers unprecedented access for researchers and encourages diverse participation in fusion and data science. The platform will address technical barriers and adhere to FAIR and Open Science principles. The researchers also plan to address barriers to participation for women and disadvantaged groups through a subsidized summer school. The project aligns with the International Atomic Energy Agency's \"AI for Fusion\" Coordinated Research Project.",
