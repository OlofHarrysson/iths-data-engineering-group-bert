    "title": "AI model speeds up high-resolution computer vision",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab have developed an efficient computer vision model for autonomous vehicles that can perform semantic segmentation in real-time on devices with limited hardware resources. The model reduces computational complexity and achieves the same accuracy as previous models. It uses a linear similarity function to build the attention map, reducing the amount of computation needed for predictions. The model, called EfficientViT, performs up to nine times faster than previous models on mobile devices. The technique could also be applied to other high-resolution computer vision tasks.",
