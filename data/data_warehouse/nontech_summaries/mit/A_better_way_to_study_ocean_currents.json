    "title": "A better way to study ocean currents",
    "summary": "Scientists have developed a new model that uses machine learning to accurately predict ocean currents and identify areas where water rises or sinks. The model, which incorporates knowledge from fluid dynamics, outperformed traditional statistical models in reconstructing currents and identifying divergences. The improved accuracy of the model could help scientists monitor the transportation of biomass, carbon, plastics, oil, and nutrients in the ocean, as well as aid in weather forecasting and understanding climate change. The researchers plan to further refine the model by incorporating a time element and accounting for noise in the data.",
