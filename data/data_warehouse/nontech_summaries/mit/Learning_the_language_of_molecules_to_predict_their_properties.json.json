    "title": "Learning the language of molecules to predict their properties",
    "summary": "Scientists from MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab have developed a new machine learning framework that can predict molecular properties and generate new molecules more efficiently than existing approaches. The system uses a molecular grammar to understand the rules of how building blocks combine to form valid molecules, allowing it to predict properties and generate new molecules with limited data. The researchers found that their system outperformed other machine learning approaches and could accurately predict properties and generate viable molecules with fewer than 100 samples.",
