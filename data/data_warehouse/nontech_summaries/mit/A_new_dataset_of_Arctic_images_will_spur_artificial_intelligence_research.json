    "title": "A new dataset of Arctic images will spur artificial intelligence research",
    "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Healy is capturing images of the Arctic during its voyage across the North Pole this summer. These images will be used to develop artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can analyze Arctic imagery. The dataset will help mariners navigate safely, improve maritime domain awareness, and understand the changing Arctic environment. Currently, there are very few imagery datasets of the Arctic available for study. The camera system installed on the Healy will provide more detailed images that can be used to train AI computer-vision tools. The goal is to develop tools that can assist the U.S. Coast Guard in planning naval missions and automate analysis. The camera system, called the Cold Region Imaging and Surveillance Platform (CRISP), includes a long-wave infrared camera that can stabilize itself during rough seas and image in complete darkness, fog, and glare. The dataset, which is expected to be about 4 terabytes in size, will be publicly released once the USCG science mission concludes in the fall. The dataset will enable the wider research community to develop better tools for operating in the Arctic and combatting climate change. The project team also plans to provide a baseline object-detection model for others to build upon.",
