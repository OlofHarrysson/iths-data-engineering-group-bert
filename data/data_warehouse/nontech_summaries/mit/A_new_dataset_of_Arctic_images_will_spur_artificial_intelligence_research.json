    "title": "A new dataset of Arctic images will spur artificial intelligence research",
    "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Healy is capturing images of the Arctic during its voyage across the North Pole to study the rapidly changing region. Researchers from Lincoln Laboratory installed a camera system on the ship to develop artificial intelligence tools that can analyze Arctic imagery. The resulting dataset will be used to improve maritime navigation, enhance national security, and gain a better understanding of the changing Arctic environment. The dataset will be publicly released for the wider research community to develop better tools for operating in the Arctic.",
