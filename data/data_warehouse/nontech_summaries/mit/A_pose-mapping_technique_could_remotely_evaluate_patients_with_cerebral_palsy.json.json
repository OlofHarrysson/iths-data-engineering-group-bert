    "title": "A pose-mapping technique could remotely evaluate patients with cerebral palsy",
    "summary": "MIT engineers have developed a method that uses computer vision and machine learning to remotely evaluate patients' motor function. The method analyzes videos of patients in real-time and computes a clinical score based on patterns of poses detected in the video frames. The researchers tested the method on videos of over 1,000 children with cerebral palsy and found that it matched the clinical scores determined by clinicians with over 70% accuracy. The team envisions that patients can be evaluated by recording videos at home and sending them to doctors for review. The method is being tailored to evaluate other conditions such as metachromatic leukodystrophy and stroke.",
