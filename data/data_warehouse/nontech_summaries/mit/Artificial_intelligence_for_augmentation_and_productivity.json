    "title": "Artificial intelligence for augmentation and productivity",
    "summary": "The MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing has awarded seed grants to seven projects that aim to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction can improve productivity and management in modern workspaces. The projects, funded by Dropbox Inc., will bring together researchers from computing, social sciences, and management to conduct interdisciplinary research. The projects include developing AI-based systems to track and organize information, simulating social scenarios with AI agents, and studying how AI can complement human decision-making. Other projects focus on using generative AI in hospitals, democratizing programming, understanding the impact of AI on skill acquisition, and improving onboarding and support using AI.",
