    "title": "Artificial intelligence for augmentation and productivity",
    "summary": "The MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing has awarded seed grants to seven projects that aim to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction can improve workspaces for better management and productivity. The projects, funded by Andrew W. Houston and Dropbox Inc., bring together researchers from computing, social sciences, and management. The grants will enable the teams to conduct research and build a community around AI-augmented management. The projects include implementing Vannevar Bush's vision of the Memex using large language models, simulating social scenarios using AI agents, exploring the role of AI in complementing human expertise, studying how generative AI can improve productivity and job quality in healthcare settings, democratizing programming through generative AI augmented software tools, understanding the impact of AI on skill acquisition and productivity, and developing AI-powered onboarding and support systems.",
