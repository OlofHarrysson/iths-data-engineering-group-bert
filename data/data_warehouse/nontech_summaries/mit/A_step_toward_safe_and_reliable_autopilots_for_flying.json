    "title": "A step toward safe and reliable autopilots for flying",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed a new machine-learning technique that can solve complex stabilize-avoid problems better than existing methods. The technique matches or exceeds the safety of current methods while providing a tenfold increase in stability. In a simulation, the technique successfully piloted a jet aircraft through a narrow corridor without crashing into the ground. The researchers believe this technique could be used to design controllers for highly dynamic robots or be implemented as part of larger systems, such as helping a car navigate back to a stable trajectory on a snowy road.",
