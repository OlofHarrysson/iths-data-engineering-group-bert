The grants will help these individuals explore the commercial applications of their research and potentially create startups. The recipients will receive funding, mentorship, and guidance, as well as access to resources and support for market research, customer discovery, and prototyping. The projects range from a predictive query interface for time series databases to the design of light-activated drugs and low-cost 3D perception technology.
