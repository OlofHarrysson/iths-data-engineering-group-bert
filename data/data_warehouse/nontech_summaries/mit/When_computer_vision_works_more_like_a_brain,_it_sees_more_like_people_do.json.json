    "title": "When computer vision works more like a brain, it sees more like people do",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT and IBM have found that training artificial neural networks to mimic the way the brain's biological neural network processes visual images can improve computer vision. By using neural activity patterns from the brain's inferior temporal cortex, the artificial neural network was able to more robustly identify objects in images and produce interpretations that closely matched human perception. The researchers also found that the neurally aligned model was more resistant to adversarial attacks, where small distortions are introduced to mislead the network. This research highlights the potential for incorporating brain-like features into computer vision models to improve their performance.",
