    "title": "When computer vision works more like a brain, it sees more like people do",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT and IBM have found that training artificial neural networks to mimic the way the brain's biological neural network processes visual images can improve computer vision. By incorporating specific brain-like features into computer vision models, the researchers were able to create a more robust model that closely matched human interpretations of images. The neurally aligned model was also more resistant to adversarial attacks, where small distortions are introduced into images to mislead the artificial neural network. This research highlights the potential for an exchange of ideas between neuroscience and computer science to drive progress in both fields.",
