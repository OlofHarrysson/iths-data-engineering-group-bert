    "title": "Self-supervised AI learns physics to reconstruct microscopic images from holograms",
    "summary": "UCLA researchers have developed a self-supervised AI model called GedankenNet that learns from physics laws and thought experiments. Unlike existing AI models, GedankenNet does not require human supervision or pre-labeled datasets, making it more efficient and cost-effective. The researchers trained GedankenNet to reconstruct microscopic images using artificial holograms created solely from imagination. The model successfully reconstructed microscopic images of human tissue samples and Pap smears, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen samples without prior experimental data. This approach has the potential to revolutionize computational imaging tasks and develop broadly generalizable neural network models.",
