    "title": "Bees make decisions better and faster than we do, for the things that matter to them",
    "summary": "A study led by Professor Andrew Barron from Macquarie University and Dr HaDi MaBouDi, Neville Dearden, and Professor James Marshall from the University of Sheffield has shed light on the decision-making process in bees. The researchers trained bees to recognize different colored flower disks and observed their decision-making process. They found that bees make decisions quickly and accurately based on their confidence in finding food. The team then built a computer model that replicated the bees' decision-making process, which resembled the physical layout of a bee brain. The study highlights the potential for using insect brains to design better robots and improve artificial intelligence.",
