    "title": "Modified virtual reality tech can measure brain activity",
    "summary": "Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin have developed a noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor that can be integrated into a comfortable virtual reality (VR) headset. The EEG measures the brain's electrical activity during immersive VR experiences, allowing for better understanding of how the brain reacts to virtual environments. The researchers believe this technology could have various applications, such as helping individuals with anxiety or measuring mental stress in aviators using flight simulators. The modified headset features soft, conductive electrodes that overcome the limitations of existing EEG devices. The researchers have filed preliminary patent paperwork and are open to partnering with VR companies to incorporate the technology.",
