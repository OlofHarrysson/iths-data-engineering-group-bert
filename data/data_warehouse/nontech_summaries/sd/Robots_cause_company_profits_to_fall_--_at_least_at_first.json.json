    "title": "Robots cause company profits to fall -- at least at first",
    "summary": "A study from the University of Cambridge has found that the adoption of robots in industries can have a U-shaped effect on profit margins. At low levels of adoption, robots have a negative impact on profits, but at higher levels, they can help increase profits. The researchers attribute this phenomenon to the relationship between reducing costs and developing new processes and products. Initially, companies focus on cost reduction, but as adoption increases, they shift their focus to product innovation, which gives them a competitive advantage. The study highlights the importance of integrating robots into the business model to fully leverage their potential for profit growth.",
