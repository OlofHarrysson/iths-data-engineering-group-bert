    "title": "This 3D printed gripper doesn't need electronics to function",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of California San Diego have developed a 3D-printed soft gripper that can pick up, hold, and release objects. The gripper is equipped with built-in gravity and touch sensors, allowing it to remember when it has grasped an object and release it at the right time. The team overcame common issues with 3D-printed soft robots, such as leaks and stiffness, by developing a new printing method that allows for thinner walls and complex shapes. The gripper has potential applications in industrial manufacturing, food production, and research tasks.",
