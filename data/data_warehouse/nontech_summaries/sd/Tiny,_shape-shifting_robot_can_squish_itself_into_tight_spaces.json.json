    "title": "Tiny, shape-shifting robot can squish itself into tight spaces",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder have developed a miniature robot called CLARI (Compliant Legged Articulated Robotic Insect) that can change its shape to navigate through tight spaces. The robot, which currently has four legs, has a modular design that allows engineers to customize and add more legs. The researchers hope to develop shape-changing robots that can navigate complex natural environments and aid in tasks such as search and rescue operations.",
