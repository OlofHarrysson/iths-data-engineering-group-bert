    "title": "Thermal imaging innovation allows AI to see through pitch darkness like broad daylight",
    "summary": "Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology called HADAR (heat-assisted detection and ranging) that combines thermal physics, infrared imaging, and machine learning to enable fully passive and physics-aware machine perception. HADAR overcomes the limitations of traditional active sensors and thermal imaging, allowing for perception in low-light conditions such as darkness, fog, and rain. The technology has potential applications in automated vehicles, robots, agriculture, defense, geosciences, healthcare, and wildlife monitoring. The researchers have applied for a patent and are seeking industry partners for further development.",
