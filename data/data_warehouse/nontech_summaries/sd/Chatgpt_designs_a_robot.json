    "title": "Chatgpt designs a robot",
    "summary": "Researchers from TU Delft and EPFL collaborated with ChatGPT, an AI language model, to design a tomato-harvesting robot. ChatGPT provided valuable suggestions during the conceptual and implementation phases of the robot's design. The researchers found the collaborative process positive, although they noted a shift in their role as engineers towards more technical tasks. However, they also highlighted the risk of misinformation and bias in relying solely on AI input. The researchers will continue to use the tomato-harvesting robot for their robotics research and explore the autonomy of AI in designing robots. They are also studying how AI language models can assist robot developers without limiting creativity and innovation.",
