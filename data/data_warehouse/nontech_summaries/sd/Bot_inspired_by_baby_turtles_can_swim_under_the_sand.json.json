    "title": "Bot inspired by baby turtles can swim under the sand",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of California San Diego have developed a robot that can travel through sand at a depth of 5 inches. The robot, inspired by sea turtle hatchlings, is equipped with force sensors to detect obstacles and can be controlled via WiFi. Moving through sand poses challenges due to high forces and the switching behavior of sand between liquid and solid states. The robot's design includes turtle-like flippers and a tapered body. Future goals include increasing speed and enabling the robot to burrow into sand. The research was supported by the Office of Naval Research.",
