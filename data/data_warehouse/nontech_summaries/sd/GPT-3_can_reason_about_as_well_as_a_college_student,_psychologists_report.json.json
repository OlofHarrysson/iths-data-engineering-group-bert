    "title": "GPT-3 can reason about as well as a college student, psychologists report",
    "summary": "A study by UCLA psychologists has found that the artificial intelligence language model GPT-3 performs at a similar level to college undergraduates when solving reasoning problems. However, the researchers question whether GPT-3 is mimicking human reasoning or using a new cognitive process. GPT-3 performs well on some reasoning tasks but fails on others, and it struggles with physical tasks that are easy for humans. The researchers hope to determine whether GPT-3 is truly thinking like a human or if it is something entirely new.",
