    "title": "Tiny, shape-shifting robot can squish itself into tight spaces",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder have developed a miniature robot called CLARI (Compliant Legged Articulated Robotic Insect) that can change its shape to navigate through tight spaces. CLARI is modular, allowing engineers to customize and add more legs, potentially creating robots with different shapes and abilities. The current version of CLARI has four legs and is tethered to wires for power and commands, but the researchers hope to develop independent crawling robots that can explore spaces like jet engines or collapsed buildings. The team also plans to incorporate sensors into CLARI to detect and react to obstacles.",
