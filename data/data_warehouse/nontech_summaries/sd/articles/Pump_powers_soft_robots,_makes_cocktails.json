    "title": "Pump powers soft robots, makes cocktails",
    "summary": "Researchers at Harvard University have developed a compact and versatile soft pump that could revolutionize the field of soft robotics. Soft robots are made from flexible materials and have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including food handling, manufacturing, and biomedical therapeutics. However, one major challenge in soft robotics is finding suitable power components that are not bulky or rigid. The team at Harvard's Microrobotics Lab designed a soft pump that is small enough to fit on a soft robot and powerful enough to actuate movement. The pump uses electrically powered dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) to create pressure waves and control the flow of liquid. The pump is capable of pumping a variety of fluids with different viscosities, making it highly versatile. The researchers believe that the pump could have applications in drug delivery and implantable therapeutic devices in addition to robotics.",
