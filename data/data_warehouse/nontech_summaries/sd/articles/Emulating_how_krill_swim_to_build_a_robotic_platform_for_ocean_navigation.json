    "title": "Emulating how krill swim to build a robotic platform for ocean navigation",
    "summary": "Researchers at Brown University have developed a small robotic platform called Pleobot that replicates the swimming method of krill. The robot is made up of three articulated sections that mimic the metachronal swimming technique of krill, allowing researchers to study the fluid-structure interactions needed for steady forward swimming. The aim of the project is to understand how krill and other metachronal swimmers function in complex marine environments and perform vertical migrations. The researchers believe that the insights gained from studying Pleobot could be used to engineer better robots for ocean navigation and potentially explore other planets' oceans.",
