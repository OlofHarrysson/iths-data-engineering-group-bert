    "title": "Bot inspired by baby turtles can swim under the sand",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of California San Diego have developed a robot that can travel through sand at a depth of 5 inches. The robot moves at a speed of 1.2 millimeters per second, which is comparable to the speed of worms and clams. It is equipped with force sensors that allow it to detect obstacles while in motion and can be controlled via WiFi. The robot has potential applications in various fields such as inspecting grain silos, measuring soil contaminants, seafloor digging, extraterrestrial exploration, and search and rescue. The researchers took inspiration from sea turtle hatchlings, which have enlarged front fins that help them surface after hatching. The robot's design includes turtle-like flippers that generate propulsive forces, allow steering, and have the potential to detect obstacles. The researchers are still working on improving the robot's speed and its ability to burrow into sand. The project is supported by the Office of Naval Research.",
