    "title": "AI nursing ethics: Viability of robots and artificial intelligence in nursing practice",
    "summary": "In a recent study, researchers from Tokyo University of Science, The University of Tokyo, and Kyoritsu Women's University explored whether robots and artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in nursing. Nursing involves empathy and building connections with patients, so the researchers wanted to see if robots and AI could replicate these qualities. They found that while AI can inform patients about medical errors and treatment options, it may struggle to truly understand and empathize with patients' values and navigate human relationships. The researchers also raised concerns about holding robots accountable for their actions and suggested the development of explainable AI. Additionally, they highlighted the importance of conducting further investigations to determine the appropriate appearance of robots for efficient cooperation with human medical staff. The researchers concluded that while robots may not fully replace human nurses in the near future, they do not dismiss the possibility. However, the ethical implications and impact on nursing practice need to be carefully considered. Further research could help address these ethical questions and lead to new discoveries in ethics.",
