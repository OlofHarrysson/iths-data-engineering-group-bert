    "title": "Sponge makes robotic device a soft touch",
    "summary": "Researchers have developed a device made from silicone sponge that can help robots handle delicate items with a soft touch. The device mimics the variable stiffness of human touch, allowing robots to grasp fragile objects like eggs without damaging them. The silicone sponge is a cheap and easy-to-fabricate material that can be transformed into a variable-stiffness device by squeezing it. This device has potential applications in industrial robots for gripping fragile substances and in service robots to improve human-robot interaction. The researchers are also exploring ways to achieve variable stiffness in multiple directions.",
