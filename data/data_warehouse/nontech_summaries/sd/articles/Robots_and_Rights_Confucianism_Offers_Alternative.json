    "title": "Robots and Rights: Confucianism Offers Alternative",
    "summary": "In this blog, the author discusses the idea of granting rights to robots and proposes an alternative approach. The author, Tae Wan Kim, argues that instead of giving robots rights, they should be seen as \"rites bearers.\" This concept is based on Confucianism, an ancient Chinese belief system that emphasizes achieving harmony and the social value of participating in proper rituals.\n\nKim suggests that assigning role obligations to robots, rather than granting them rights, is a more appropriate way to address their moral status. This approach encourages teamwork and harmony between humans and robots, rather than potential conflict. Kim also notes that robots should be powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that can imitate humans' capacity to recognize and execute team activities.\n\nThe author acknowledges that some may question why robots should be treated respectfully in the first place. Kim suggests that if we create robots in our image and do not treat them well, we degrade ourselves. The author also points out that non-natural entities like corporations are considered people and have certain rights, and that moral and legal considerations prevent the gratuitous use of animals in lab experiments.\n\nOverall, the blog argues for a different perspective on the moral status of robots, focusing on their role obligations rather than granting them rights.",
