    "title": "Shining a light on neuromorphic computing",
    "summary": "A recent review article titled \"Integrated Optical Memristors\" explores the potential of optical memristors, which are analogs of electronic memristors, in revolutionizing high-bandwidth neuromorphic computing, machine learning hardware, and artificial intelligence in the optical domain. Optical memristors offer advantages such as ultrafast, high-bandwidth optical communication and local information processing. However, the scalability of this technology is a challenge that needs to be addressed. The article highlights the need for a technology that is fast, compact, and efficient to enable scaling in-memory or neuromorphic computing in the optical domain. The current limitations include low storage density and the need for large memory cells. Improving storage density, energy efficiency, and programming speed is crucial for useful computing at useful scales. Optical memristors have the potential to revolutionize computing and information processing in various applications, including active trimming of photonic integrated circuits, high-speed data storage and retrieval, artificial synapses, and brain-inspired architectures. However, there is still a need to find a material or device that meets all the criteria for an ideal optical memristor. Further research and development in this field could unlock unprecedented possibilities for high-bandwidth neuromorphic computing, machine learning hardware, and artificial intelligence.",
