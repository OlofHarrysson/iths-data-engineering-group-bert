    "title": "3D display could soon bring touch to the digital world",
    "summary": "Researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder have developed a shape-shifting display that can fit on a card table. The display is made up of a grid of soft robotic \"muscles\" that can sense pressure and create patterns by popping up. It is precise enough to generate scrolling text and fast enough to shake a beaker filled with fluid. The researchers believe that this technology could eventually lead to sensory gloves for virtual gaming or smart conveyer belts that can sort objects. The project originated from the development of synthetic organs made from silicone-like materials. The researchers are now working on increasing the resolution of the display and exploring the possibility of creating a glove that allows users to \"feel\" objects in virtual reality.",
