    "title": "AI helps show how the brain's fluids flow",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Rochester have developed a new technique using artificial intelligence (AI) to measure the flow of fluid in the brain. The fluid, which surrounds blood vessels in the brain, plays a crucial role in transporting fluids and removing waste. Changes in fluid flow have been linked to neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and strokes, but measuring these changes accurately has been challenging. The team of mechanical engineers, neuroscientists, and computer scientists combined existing measurements with AI technology to create high-resolution images of the fluid flow. This new technique provides more accurate measurements of pressure, forces, and three-dimensional flow rates, helping researchers better understand the brain's fluid system. The research was supported by various organizations, including the National Institutes of Health and the Army Research Office.",
