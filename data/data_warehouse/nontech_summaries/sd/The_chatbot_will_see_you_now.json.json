    "summary": "Researchers from the University of California Irvine, Children's National Hospital, and Invitae Corporation have developed a chatbot called GIA to obtain informed consent for medical research. The chatbot was designed to quiz participants and assess their knowledge, making the consent process more interactive and accessible. In a study involving 72 families, the researchers found that the chatbot reduced the time and effort required for consent, with shorter conversations and faster completion times. Participants also reported a positive experience and high levels of understanding. The researchers believe that the chatbot could improve the process of obtaining informed consent and should be used in different languages to reach a global audience.",
