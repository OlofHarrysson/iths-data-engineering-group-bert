    "title": "Out with the life coach, in with the chatbot",
    "summary": "A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by researchers at the University of South Australia has found that chatbots can effectively improve physical activity, diet, and sleep. The study, published in Nature Digital Medicine, revealed that chatbots led to an increase in daily steps, consumption of fruits and vegetables, and sleep duration. These findings highlight the potential of artificial intelligence to revolutionize healthcare delivery. However, a blended approach of chatbots and human coaching may be the most beneficial, as caution is needed to ensure appropriate advice is given.",
