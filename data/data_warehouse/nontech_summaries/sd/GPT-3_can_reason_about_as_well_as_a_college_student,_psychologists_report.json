    "title": "GPT-3 can reason about as well as a college student, psychologists report",
    "summary": "A recent study conducted by UCLA psychologists found that the artificial intelligence language model GPT-3 performs at a similar level to college undergraduates when it comes to solving reasoning problems typically found on intelligence tests and standardized exams like the SAT. However, the researchers are unsure whether GPT-3 is mimicking human reasoning or using a completely new cognitive process. The study also revealed that while GPT-3 excels in some reasoning tasks, it fails spectacularly in others. The researchers compared GPT-3's performance to that of human subjects and found that it solved 80% of the problems correctly, surpassing the average human score. However, GPT-3 struggled with problems that required understanding physical space and proposing practical solutions. The researchers hope to further investigate whether language learning models like GPT-3 are truly thinking like humans or if they are utilizing a different approach. To do so, they would need access to the software and training data used by GPT-3.",
