    "title": "Robot team on lunar exploration tour",
    "summary": "Researchers from ETH Zurich and other Swiss universities have developed a team of legged robots, called ANYmal, that can explore unknown terrains. The team consists of two specialist robots, one for mapping and classifying geology and the other for identifying rocks, and a generalist robot that can perform both tasks with less precision. The use of multiple robots provides redundancy and allows for compensation in case of failure. The researchers also plan to make the robots more autonomous and combine different types of robots, such as those with wheels or flying capabilities, for future missions.",
