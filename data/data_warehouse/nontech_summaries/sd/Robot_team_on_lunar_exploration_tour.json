    "title": "Robot team on lunar exploration tour",
    "summary": "Researchers from ETH Zurich and several other universities have developed a team of legged robots called ANYmal that can explore unknown terrains. The team equipped three robots with different measuring and analysis instruments to make them suitable for exploration. Two of the robots were specialists, with one focused on mapping and classifying the terrain, and the other on identifying rocks. The third robot was a generalist that could perform both tasks with less precision. This redundancy in the team allows for compensation in case of a robot failure. The researchers won a European competition for lunar exploration robots and were awarded a one-year research contract to further develop the technology. They plan to combine legged robots with robots with wheels and potentially flying robots for future missions. The goal is to make the robots more autonomous, with the ability to assign tasks to each other.",
