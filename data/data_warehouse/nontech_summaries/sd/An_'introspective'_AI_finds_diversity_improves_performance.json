    "title": "An 'introspective' AI finds diversity improves performance",
    "summary": "Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is able to choose diversity over homogeneity in its neural network, resulting in improved performance. The AI was given the ability to modify the composition of its neural network, creating sub-networks of different neuron types and connection strengths. The team found that the AI consistently chose diversity as a way to strengthen its performance, and the accuracy of the AI increased as the number of neurons and neuronal diversity increased. The diversity-based AI was up to 10 times more accurate than conventional AI in solving complex problems.",
