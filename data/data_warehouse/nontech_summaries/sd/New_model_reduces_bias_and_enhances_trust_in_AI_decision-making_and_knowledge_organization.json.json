    "title": "New model reduces bias and enhances trust in AI decision-making and knowledge organization",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Waterloo have developed a new model called Pattern Discovery and Disentanglement (PDD) that aims to eliminate bias and improve trust and reliability in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The PDD model untangles complex patterns from data to relate them to specific underlying causes, allowing for more accurate diagnoses and equitable healthcare outcomes. The model has been successful in predicting patients' medical results based on their clinical records and can also detect mislabels or anomalies in machine learning. The PDD model has received an NSER Idea-to-Innovation Grant and is being commercialized through the Waterloo Commercialization Office.",
