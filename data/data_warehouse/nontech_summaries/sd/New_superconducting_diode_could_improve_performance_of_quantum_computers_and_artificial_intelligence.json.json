    "title": "New superconducting diode could improve performance of quantum computers and artificial intelligence",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a superconducting diode that could potentially enhance the power and energy efficiency of computers. The device, made using three Josephson junctions, allows for the control of current flow using voltage. Unlike traditional diodes, this device can process multiple signal inputs, making it suitable for neuromorphic computing. The researchers believe that their device, which is made using industry-friendly materials, could help scale up the development of quantum computers for practical applications. The research was funded by the US Department of Energy, Microsoft Research, and the National Science Foundation.",
