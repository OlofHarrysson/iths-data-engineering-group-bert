    "title": "Emulating how krill swim to build a robotic platform for ocean navigation",
    "summary": "Researchers at Brown University have developed a small robotic platform called Pleobot that replicates the swimming method of krill. The robot, made up of three articulated sections, emulates the metachronal swimming technique of krill, allowing scientists to study the fluid-structure interactions needed for steady forward swimming. The researchers hope that Pleobot will provide insights into how to engineer better underwater robots for ocean navigation. The project is a collaboration between Brown University and the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico.",
