    "title": "Better than humans: Artificial intelligence in intensive care units",
    "summary": "Researchers at TU Wien (Vienna) have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses machine learning to provide treatment suggestions for patients in intensive care units with sepsis. The AI system, which takes into account a wide range of medical data, has been found to outperform human decision-making in terms of cure rates. However, the legal implications of using AI in healthcare need to be discussed, including questions of liability and the right of doctors to ignore AI recommendations. The researchers believe that while AI can be successfully used in clinical practice, clear legal rules and a social framework are necessary.",
