    "title": "3D display could soon bring touch to the digital world",
    "summary": "Engineers from the University of Colorado Boulder have developed a shape-shifting display made from a grid of soft robotic \"muscles\" that can sense pressure and create patterns. The display is precise enough to generate scrolling text and fast enough to shake a chemistry beaker. The researchers envision that this technology could lead to sensory gloves for virtual gaming or smart conveyer belts. The project originated from the development of synthetic organs and the researchers are now working on increasing the resolution of the display and creating a glove that allows users to \"feel\" objects in virtual reality.",
