    "title": "AI nursing ethics: Viability of robots and artificial intelligence in nursing practice",
    "summary": "A recent study by researchers from Tokyo University of Science, The University of Tokyo, and Kyoritsu Women's University explores the potential for robots and AI to be used in nursing. The researchers examine whether robots and AI can replicate the ethical concepts attributed to human nurses, such as advocacy, accountability, cooperation, and caring. While AI can inform patients and present treatment options, the researchers question its ability to truly understand and empathize with patients' values and effectively navigate human relationships. They also highlight the importance of conducting further investigations to determine the appropriate appearance of robots for efficient cooperation with human medical staff. The researchers acknowledge that robots may not fully replace human nurses, but their deployment requires careful consideration of ethical implications and impact on nursing practice.",
