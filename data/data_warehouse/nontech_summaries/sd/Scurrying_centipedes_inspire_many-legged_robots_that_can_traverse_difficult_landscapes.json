    "title": "Scurrying centipedes inspire many-legged robots that can traverse difficult landscapes",
    "summary": "Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a theory of multilegged locomotion and created many-legged robotic models that can move across uneven surfaces without additional sensing or control technology. These robots have the potential to be used in agriculture, space exploration, and search and rescue. The researchers are also applying their discoveries to farming, using the robots to weed farmland where weedkillers are ineffective. The next steps for the researchers include refining the robot and determining the optimal number of legs for cost-effective and efficient motion without sensing.",
