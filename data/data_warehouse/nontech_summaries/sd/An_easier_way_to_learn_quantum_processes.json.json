    "title": "An easier way to learn quantum processes",
    "summary": "Researchers at EPFL, Caltech, the Free University of Berlin, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory have developed a new method to teach quantum computers how to understand and predict the behavior of quantum systems. Using quantum neural networks (QNNs), which operate on the principles of quantum mechanics, the researchers showed that computers can learn about and understand quantum systems using just a few simple examples called \"product states.\" This breakthrough could lead to the development of better quantum computers and improve their efficiency and reliability.",
