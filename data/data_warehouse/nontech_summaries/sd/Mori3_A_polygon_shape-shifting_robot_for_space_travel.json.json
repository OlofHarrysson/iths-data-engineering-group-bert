    "title": "Mori3: A polygon shape-shifting robot for space travel",
    "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed a modular robot called Mori3 that can morph from 2D triangles into various 3D objects. The robot's individual triangular modules can easily join together to create different shapes and sizes through a process called polygon meshing. The researchers believe that this modular and multi-functional robot has potential applications in space travel, where robots need to be versatile and adaptable to perform various tasks in limited space. The Mori3 robot could be used for communication purposes and external repairs in spacecraft.",
