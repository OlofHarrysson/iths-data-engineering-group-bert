    "title": "Online AI-based test for Parkinson's disease severity shows promising results",
    "summary": "An AI model has been developed to assess the severity of Parkinson's disease by analyzing the performance of patients in simple motor tasks. The model uses guidelines such as the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) to generate computational metrics and classify the severity of tremors. In a study comparing the AI model's ratings with those of neurologists and primary care physicians, the AI model outperformed the primary care physicians. The researchers believe this technology could improve access to healthcare for patients who struggle to see neurologists. The method could also be applied to other movement disorders. However, the researchers caution that the AI assessment should not be considered a definitive measure of the disease without a physician's input.",
