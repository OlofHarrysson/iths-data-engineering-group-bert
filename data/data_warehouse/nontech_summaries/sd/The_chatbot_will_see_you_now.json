    "summary": "Researchers from the University of California Irvine, Children's National Hospital, and Invitae Corporation have developed a chatbot called GIA to streamline the process of obtaining consent for medical research trials. The chatbot was designed to transform the trial consent form and protocol into a logic flow and script, allowing participants to interact with it and assess their knowledge. The researchers found that using the chatbot resulted in shorter consent conversations and faster completion times compared to traditional methods. Participants also reported a positive experience with the chatbot. The researchers believe that the chatbot can improve the process of obtaining informed consent and are interested in expanding its use to reach global populations.",
