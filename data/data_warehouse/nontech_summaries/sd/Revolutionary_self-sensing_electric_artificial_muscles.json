    "title": "Revolutionary self-sensing electric artificial muscles",
    "summary": "Researchers at Queen Mary University of London have developed a new type of electric artificial muscle that can transition between soft and hard states and has self-sensing capabilities. This breakthrough technology has the potential to revolutionize soft robotics and medical applications. The artificial muscle exhibits flexibility and stretchability similar to natural muscle, making it ideal for integration into intricate soft robotic systems. It can withstand over 200% stretch and rapidly adjust its stiffness by applying different voltages. The muscle can also monitor its deformation through resistance changes, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The fabrication process is simple and reliable, using carbon nanotubes mixed with liquid silicone. The potential applications of this technology are vast, including aiding individuals with disabilities and assisting in rehabilitation training. While there are still challenges to be addressed, this research represents a crucial step towards human-machine integration and the future development of soft and wearable robots.",
