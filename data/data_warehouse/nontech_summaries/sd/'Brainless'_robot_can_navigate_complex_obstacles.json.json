    "title": "'Brainless' robot can navigate complex obstacles",
    "summary": "Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed a new soft robot that is capable of navigating through twisty mazes and moving obstacles. The robot uses physical intelligence, meaning its behavior is governed by its structural design and materials rather than being guided by a computer. The robot is made of ribbon-like liquid crystal elastomers and has an asymmetrical design that allows it to turn without coming into contact with objects. The researchers demonstrated the robot's ability to navigate complex mazes and fit through narrow spaces. The design could have applications in harvesting heat energy from the environment.",
