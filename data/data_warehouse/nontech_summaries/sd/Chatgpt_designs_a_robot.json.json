    "title": "Chatgpt designs a robot",
    "summary": "Researchers from TU Delft and EPFL collaborated with ChatGPT, an AI language model, to design a tomato-harvesting robot. ChatGPT provided valuable input during the conceptual and implementation phases, suggesting the most economically valuable crop to automate and design features like a silicone gripper and Dynamixel motor. However, the researchers caution that relying solely on AI input can lead to misinformation and bias. They also explore the varying degrees of cooperation between humans and AI in the design process. The researchers will continue to use the robot in their research and study the autonomy of AI in designing robots.",
