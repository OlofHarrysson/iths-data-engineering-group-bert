    "title": "Researchers build bee robot that can twist",
    "summary": "Researchers at Washington State University have developed a robotic bee prototype called Bee++ that can fly stably in all directions, including yaw, which is a twisting motion. Led by N\u00e9stor O. P\u00e9rez-Arancibia, the team used carbon fiber and mylar to create four wings and lightweight actuators to control each wing. The researchers believe that artificial flying insects like Bee++ could have various applications, such as artificial pollination, search and rescue missions, biological research, and environmental monitoring. The development of controllers that mimic insect brains was crucial for the robot to take off and land successfully. The researchers are also working on other types of insect robots, including crawlers and water striders.",
