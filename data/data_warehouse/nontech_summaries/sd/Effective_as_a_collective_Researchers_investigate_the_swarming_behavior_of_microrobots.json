    "title": "Effective as a collective: Researchers investigate the swarming behavior of microrobots",
    "summary": "Researchers at Mainz University are exploring the use of collectives of robotic units to solve tasks that a single robot cannot accomplish alone. The researchers studied the collective behavior of small robots propelled by internal vibrations and observed that when the robots had variations in their orbits, they required less time to explore a space and began to undergo self-organized sorting. This collective behavior could be utilized to transport loads and interact with them more efficiently. The study was funded by the Collaborative Research Center/TRR 146 and the conclusions were based on experiments and model computations. The researchers believe that statistical physics can uncover new strategies for collectives of robots.",
