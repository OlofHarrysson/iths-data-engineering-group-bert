    "title": "Robotic glove that 'feels' lends a 'hand'  to relearn playing piano after a stroke",
    "summary": "Researchers from Florida Atlantic University have developed a robotic glove that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to improve hand dexterity in stroke patients. The glove, which combines flexible tactile sensors, soft actuators, and AI, is the first to \"feel\" the difference between correct and incorrect versions of a song and provide real-time feedback and adjustments. The glove's capabilities were demonstrated by programming it to differentiate between correct and incorrect versions of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" played on the piano. The glove has the potential to aid individuals with disabilities in relearning dexterous tasks like playing musical instruments.",
