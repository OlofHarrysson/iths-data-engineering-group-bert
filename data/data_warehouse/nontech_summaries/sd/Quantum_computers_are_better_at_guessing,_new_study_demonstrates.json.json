    "title": "Quantum computers are better at guessing, new study demonstrates",
    "summary": "Researchers have demonstrated that quantum computers can solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers, even in the presence of noise. The study used a game-like scenario to evaluate the performance of a quantum algorithm, showing that a perfectly functioning quantum computer could identify a 26-bit string in just one guess, compared to approximately 33 million guesses required by a classical computer. The researchers achieved this quantum speedup by using a noise suppression technique called dynamical decoupling. While classical computers can still solve the problem faster in absolute terms, the study highlights the potential of quantum computers in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.",
