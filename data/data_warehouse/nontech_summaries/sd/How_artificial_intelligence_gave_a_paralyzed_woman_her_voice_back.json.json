    "title": "How artificial intelligence gave a paralyzed woman her voice back",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) have developed a brain-computer interface (BCI) system that can synthesize speech and facial expressions from brain signals. The system can decode brain signals into text at a rate of nearly 80 words per minute, a significant improvement over existing technology. The researchers hope that this breakthrough will lead to an FDA-approved system for speech restoration in the near future. The team implanted electrodes onto the surface of a woman's brain and trained the AI algorithms to recognize her unique brain signals for speech. The system decodes words from phonemes, making it more accurate and faster. The researchers also created an algorithm to synthesize speech and animated an avatar to mimic facial movements. The next step is to develop a wireless version of the system.",
