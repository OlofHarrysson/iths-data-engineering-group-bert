    "title": "Bees make decisions better and faster than we do, for the things that matter to them",
    "summary": "A recent study led by Professor Andrew Barron from Macquarie University and Dr HaDi MaBouDi, Neville Dearden, and Professor James Marshall from the University of Sheffield has shed light on the decision-making abilities of bees. The study found that bees are able to make decisions quickly and accurately, despite having a brain smaller than a sesame seed. The researchers trained bees to recognize different colored flower disks and observed their decision-making process. They found that bees made decisions quickly when they were confident that a flower would have food, but took more time when they were unsure. The team then built a computer model based on the bees' decision-making process and found that it closely resembled the physical layout of a bee brain. The study highlights the potential for AI researchers to learn from insects and other animals to design better robots.",
