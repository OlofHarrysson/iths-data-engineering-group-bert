    "title": "Can't find your phone? There's a robot for that",
    "summary": "Researchers have developed a companion robot with artificial intelligence (AI) that can help people with dementia find misplaced objects. The robot uses a camera to detect and track objects, creating a memory log of their location. Users can choose objects to be tracked and search for them using a smartphone app or computer. The robot can then indicate when and where it last observed the specific object. The technology has the potential to improve the independence and quality of life for people with dementia. The researchers plan to conduct user studies with both disabled and non-disabled individuals.",
