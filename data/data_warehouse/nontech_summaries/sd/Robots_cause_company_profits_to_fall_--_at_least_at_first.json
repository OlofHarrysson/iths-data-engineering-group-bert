    "title": "Robots cause company profits to fall -- at least at first",
    "summary": "Researchers from the University of Cambridge have found that the adoption of robots in industries can have a U-shaped effect on profit margins. At low levels of adoption, robots have a negative impact on profit margins, but at higher levels of adoption, they can help increase profits. The researchers attribute this phenomenon to the relationship between reducing costs, developing new processes, and innovating new products. Initially, companies adopt robots to decrease costs, but this process innovation can be easily copied by competitors. However, as robot adoption increases and they are fully integrated into a company's processes, they can be used to increase revenue through product innovation. The study analyzed industry data from the UK and 24 other European countries between 1995 and 2017. The researchers also conducted interviews with an American medical equipment manufacturer to understand their experiences with robot adoption. The findings suggest that companies need to adapt their business models concurrently with robot adoption to reach the profitable side of the U-shaped curve more quickly. The research was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Economic and Social Research Council.",
