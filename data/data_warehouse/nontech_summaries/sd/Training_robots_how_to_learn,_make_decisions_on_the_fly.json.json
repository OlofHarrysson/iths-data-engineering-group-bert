    "title": "Training robots how to learn, make decisions on the fly",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Illinois have developed a new method for autonomous landers to quickly learn how to scoop on new materials they encounter. The method involves using a deep Gaussian process model trained on an offline database, which allows the robot to adapt to changing landscapes and properties of materials. The researchers created a large-scale dataset on granular media and have made it open source for others to use. The model will be deployed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Ocean World Lander Autonomy Testbed.",
