    "title": "Brain signals transformed into speech through implants and AI",
    "summary": "Researchers at Radboud University's Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour and UMC Utrecht have made progress in developing a brain-computer interface that can infer what people are saying. By using brain implants in patients with epilepsy, the researchers were able to map brain activity to speech and translate it into audible sounds. The technology has the potential to give a voice to patients who are paralyzed and unable to communicate. While there are still limitations, such as predicting full sentences, the researchers are optimistic about the future of this technology.",
