    "title": "Robotic proxy brings remote users to life in real time",
    "summary": "Researchers at Cornell University have developed a robot called ReMotion that aims to improve remote collaboration by providing nonverbal cues. The robot mirrors the movements of a remote user wearing a tracking device, allowing for more dynamic interactions. In a small study, participants reported feeling a better connection with their remote teammates when using ReMotion compared to other telerobotic systems. The researchers hope to further develop the robot for use in virtual collaborative environments, classrooms, and other educational settings. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Nakajima Foundation.",
