    "title": "Ecology and artificial intelligence: Stronger together",
    "summary": "A new paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences argues for a synergy between artificial intelligence (AI) and ecology that could benefit both fields and help solve global challenges such as disease outbreaks, loss of biodiversity, and climate change impacts. The paper suggests that AI can be used in ecology to analyze large data sets, find missing links in complex systems, and generate unique hypotheses. On the other hand, ecological principles can help improve AI by making it more robust, adaptable, and capable of reasoning beyond specific data. The authors emphasize the need for closer collaboration between AI and ecology to achieve transformative perspectives and solutions.",
