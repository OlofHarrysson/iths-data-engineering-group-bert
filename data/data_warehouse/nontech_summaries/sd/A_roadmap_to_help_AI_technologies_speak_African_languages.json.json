    "title": "A roadmap to help AI technologies speak African languages",
    "summary": "AI researcher Kathleen Siminyu of the Masakhane Research Foundation emphasizes the need for accessible AI tools for African languages. The research team conducted interviews with key players involved in developing African language tools and identified four central themes: the importance of African languages in cultural identity and societal participation, the need to support African content creation, collaboration between linguistics and computer science, and the ethical collection and use of data. The team plans to expand the study and hopes their findings will guide the development of language tools and preserve indigenous African languages.",
