    "title": "Robotic hand rotates objects using touch, not vision",
    "summary": "Researchers have developed a robotic hand that can rotate objects using only touch information. The hand is equipped with 16 low-cost touch sensors that detect whether an object is touching them or not. This approach is unique because it relies on many sensors spread over a large area of the hand, unlike other methods that use a few high-resolution sensors. The researchers trained the system using simulations and tested it on real-life objects, successfully rotating a variety of items without losing grip. The technique could help develop robots that can manipulate objects in the dark.",
