    "title": "Pump powers soft robots, makes cocktails",
    "summary": "Researchers at Harvard University have developed a compact and versatile soft pump for use in soft robotics. The pump, which is small enough to fit on board a small soft robot, can pump a variety of fluids with different viscosities and is powerful enough to actuate movement. The pump's size, power, and versatility open up possibilities for soft robots in various applications, including food handling, manufacturing, and biomedical therapeutics. The research was published in Science Robotics and was supported by the National Science Foundation.",
