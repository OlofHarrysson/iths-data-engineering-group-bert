    "title": "New AI technology gives robot recognition skills a big lift",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Texas at Dallas have developed a robotic system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help robots better identify and remember objects. The system allows the robot to push objects multiple times, collecting a sequence of images that enable the robot to segment and recognize the objects. This approach is an improvement over previous methods that relied on a single push or grasp. The researchers presented their findings at the Robotics: Science and Systems conference in South Korea. The next step for the researchers is to improve other functions, such as planning and control.",
