    "title": "An 'introspective' AI finds diversity improves performance",
    "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) that embraces diversity and has the ability to modify its neural network structure is up to 10 times more accurate than conventional AI, according to a study by researchers at North Carolina State University. The team created an AI system that could choose the number, shape, and connection strength between neurons in its neural network, allowing it to create sub-networks of different neuron types and connection strengths. The AI consistently chose diversity over homogeneity, resulting in improved performance and accuracy in solving complex problems.",
