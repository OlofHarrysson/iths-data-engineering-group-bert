    "title": "The influence of AI on trust in human interaction",
    "summary": "Researchers from the University of Gothenburg have explored the issue of trust and suspicion in interactions with AI agents. They found that people often take a long time to realize they are interacting with a computer system, even when the behavior is suspicious. The researchers suggest that AI should have synthetic voices that are clearly not human, to increase transparency and avoid confusion. They also highlight the negative consequences of suspicion, such as damage to relationships. The study analyzed conversations and audience reactions on YouTube to understand how people interpret and relate to AI agents.",
