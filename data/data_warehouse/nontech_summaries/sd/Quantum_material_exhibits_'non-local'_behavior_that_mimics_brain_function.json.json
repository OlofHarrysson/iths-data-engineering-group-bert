    "title": "Quantum material exhibits 'non-local' behavior that mimics brain function",
    "summary": "The Quantum Materials for Energy Efficient Neuromorphic Computing (Q-MEEN-C) consortium, led by the University of California San Diego, is working on creating brain-like computers with minimal energy requirements. In the first phase of their research, they successfully created or mimicked the properties of a single brain element using quantum materials. In the second phase, they discovered non-locality, where electrical stimuli passed between neighboring electrodes can affect non-neighboring electrodes, a crucial milestone in neuromorphic computing. The team developed a device using a thin film of nickelate that can remember perturbations and create more conductive pathways. This non-local behavior allows for simpler circuit designs and could lead to a hardware revolution in artificial intelligence.",
