    "title": "Hybrid AI-powered computer vision combines physics and big data",
    "summary": "A study published in Nature Machine Intelligence discusses a hybrid methodology that combines physics and data-driven approaches to improve the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in computer vision. By incorporating an understanding of physics into AI networks, researchers have found that AI can track and predict object motion more accurately and produce high-resolution images in challenging conditions. This dual modality approach may even enable AI to learn the laws of physics independently. The study highlights the potential for enhanced AI applications in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and healthcare. The research was supported by grants from the Army Research Laboratory and various other organizations.",
