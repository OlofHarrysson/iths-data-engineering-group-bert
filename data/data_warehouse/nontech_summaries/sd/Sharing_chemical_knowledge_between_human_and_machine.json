    "title": "Sharing chemical knowledge between human and machine",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Jena and the Westphalian University of Applied Sciences have developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool called DECIMER (Deep Learning for Chemical Image Recognition) that can translate chemical structural formulae into machine-readable code. The tool uses AI algorithms to identify and classify images in scientific articles, specifically focusing on chemical structural formulae. Once identified, the tool translates the formulae into machine-readable code or displays them in a structure editor for further processing. The tool has been trained using existing machine-readable databases and is freely available for use on the internet. The researchers hope to use DECIMER to machine-read chemical literature and translate it into open databases, making scientific information more accessible to the global scientific community.",
