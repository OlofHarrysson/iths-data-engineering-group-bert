    "title": "Sponge makes robotic device a soft touch",
    "summary": "Researchers have developed a silicone sponge-based device that can provide variable stiffness to robots, allowing them to handle delicate objects with a soft touch. The device, which is cheap and easy to fabricate, can be mounted on the end of a robotic arm and is capable of gripping fragile substances such as eggs and jellies. The researchers believe that this device has great potential in industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. Future work will focus on achieving variable stiffness in multiple directions.",
