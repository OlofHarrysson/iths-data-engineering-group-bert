    "title": "Modified virtual reality tech can measure brain activity",
    "summary": "Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin have developed a noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor that can be integrated into a comfortable virtual reality (VR) headset. The EEG measures the brain's electrical activity during immersive VR experiences. The device has various potential applications, such as helping individuals with anxiety, measuring attention or mental stress in flight simulators, and allowing humans to see through the eyes of a robot. The researchers created a spongy electrode made of soft, conductive materials to overcome the limitations of existing EEG devices. The modified headset features electrodes across the top strap and forehead pad, a flexible circuit with conductive traces, and an EEG recording device attached to the back of the headset. The researchers have filed preliminary patent paperwork for the EEG and are open to partnering with VR companies to create a built-in version of the technology.",
