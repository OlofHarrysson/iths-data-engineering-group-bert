    "title": "Robot centipedes go for a walk",
    "summary": "Researchers from Osaka University have developed a biomimetic robot that mimics the movement of animals with legs. Unlike previous legged robots, which are often fragile and require a lot of computational power to control, this new robot takes advantage of a natural instability that allows it to convert straight walking into curved motion. The robot consists of six segments, each with two legs, and flexible joints that can be adjusted during walking. By increasing the flexibility of the joints, the robot transitions from straight walking to walking in a curved pattern. This controlled use of instability enables efficient maneuverability and reduces computational complexity and energy requirements. The researchers tested the robot's ability to navigate and found that it could reach specific locations by taking curved paths. This technology has potential applications in search and rescue, hazardous environments, and exploration on other planets. Future versions of the robot may include additional segments and control mechanisms.",
