    "title": "A simpler method for learning to control a robot",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT and Stanford have developed a machine learning technique that incorporates control theory to enable robots and autonomous vehicles to learn effective controllers for complex dynamics. By learning the system's dynamics and control-oriented structures from data, the approach can create controllers that perform more effectively in real-world environments. The technique also requires less data than other approaches, making it more efficient and suitable for rapidly changing conditions. The researchers believe their approach could be applied to a wide range of dynamical systems.",
