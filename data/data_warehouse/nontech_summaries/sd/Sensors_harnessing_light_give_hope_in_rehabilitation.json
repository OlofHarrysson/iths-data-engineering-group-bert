    "title": "Sensors harnessing light give hope in rehabilitation",
    "summary": "Researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) have developed a new type of strain sensor that overcomes the limitations of conventional soft strain sensors. The new sensor, called computer vision-based optical strain (CVOS), uses computer vision and optical sensors to analyze microscale optical patterns and detect changes in the body. This approach improves durability and simplifies the fabrication process, making the sensors more commercially viable. Unlike traditional sensors that only detect biaxial strain, CVOS sensors can detect three-axial rotational movements, allowing for more precise recognition of bodily motions. The researchers conducted experiments using CVOS sensors in rehabilitative treatments and found that they consistently performed well, even after more than 10,000 iterations. The lead researcher, Professor Sung-Min Park, believes that CVOS sensors have the potential for a wide range of applications in various industries.",
