    "title": "Robotics: New skin-like sensors fit almost everywhere",
    "summary": "Researchers from the Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI) at TUM have developed a new framework for creating soft sensors that can be wrapped around objects. These sensors are made using a 3D printer that injects a conductive black paste into liquid silicone, which hardens around the paste. When the sensors are squeezed or stretched, their electrical resistance changes, providing valuable data on interactions with objects. This technology has the potential to revolutionize industries such as robotics and prosthetics by allowing for wireless and customizable sensor technology for various objects and machines.",
