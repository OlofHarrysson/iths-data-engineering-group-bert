    "title": "Reinforcement learning allows underwater robots to locate and track objects underwater",
    "summary": "Underwater robotics is becoming increasingly important for exploring the oceans and gathering data. Researchers have found that reinforcement learning, a type of artificial intelligence, can be used to train underwater robots to optimize their actions and achieve specific goals. This technology has the potential to improve the study of ecological phenomena and monitor oceanographic instruments in real time. The researchers used range acoustic techniques and neural networks to train the algorithms, and tested them on autonomous vehicles in experimental missions. Future research will explore more complex missions and applications of the algorithms.",
