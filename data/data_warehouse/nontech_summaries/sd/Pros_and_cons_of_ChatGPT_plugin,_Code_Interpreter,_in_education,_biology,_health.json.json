    "title": "Pros and cons of ChatGPT plugin, Code Interpreter, in education, biology, health",
    "summary": "Code Interpreter, an artificial intelligence chatbot plugin developed by OpenAI, has gained popularity since its release in December 2022. While it has proven useful in educational settings for coding in STEM fields, it falls short in meeting the needs of bioinformatics, a field that combines computer science and biology. The plugin lacks certain features required for bioinformatics tasks, such as precise coding, software programs specific to the field, internet access for downloading genome data, and the ability to work with large files. However, Code Interpreter shows promise in minimizing hallucinations and providing a source or citation for responses through the use of coding. Future developments are expected to address these limitations and extend the plugin's use to various fields, including bioinformatics.",
