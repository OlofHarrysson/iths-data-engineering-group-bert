    "title": "Mori3: A polygon shape-shifting robot for space travel",
    "summary": "Researchers at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) have developed a modular robot called Mori3 that can morph from 2D triangles into various 3D objects. The robot's individual triangular modules can easily join together to create different shapes and sizes through a process called polygon meshing. The team had to push the boundaries of robotics in terms of mechanical and electronic design, computer systems, and engineering to achieve this. The Mori3 robot is versatile and can be used for a wide range of tasks, making it suitable for space travel where storage space is limited. The researchers envision using Mori3 robots for communication purposes and external repairs in spacecraft.",
