    "title": "AI that uses sketches to detect objects within an image could boost tumor detection, and search for rare bird species",
    "summary": "The University of Surrey will present a sketch-based object detection tool at the CVPR conference. The tool allows users to sketch an object, which the AI will use to search for a matching object in an image. The tool takes into account visual cues such as pose and structure, allowing for more precise object detection. This technology has potential applications in fields such as medicine and wildlife conservation. The University of Surrey is known for its research in AI and has a strong presence at the CVPR conference.",
