    "title": "Democratic inputs to AI",
    "summary": "OpenAI is launching a grant program to develop proof-of-concepts for a democratic process that can determine the rules and behavior of AI systems. They believe that decisions about AI behavior should be shaped by diverse perspectives reflecting the public interest. The grant recipients will receive $100,000 to pilot their proposals, engaging at least 500 participants, and will be required to publish a public report on their findings. OpenAI aims to establish democratic processes for overseeing AI and ensuring strong public oversight in the governance of powerful AI systems.",
