    "title": "Using GPT-4 for content moderation",
    "summary": "OpenAI is exploring the use of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, for content moderation on digital platforms. This approach allows for faster iteration on policy changes, reducing the time from months to hours. GPT-4 can interpret and adapt to policy updates, resulting in more consistent labeling. The process involves creating a golden set of data based on policy guidelines, comparing GPT-4's judgments to human judgments, and refining the policy accordingly. This AI-assisted moderation system offers a more positive future for digital platforms, relieving the burden on human moderators.",
