    "summary": "OpenAI is introducing custom instructions for ChatGPT, allowing users to tailor the AI model's responses to their specific needs. This feature will be available in beta for Plus plan users initially and will expand to all users in the coming weeks. Custom instructions eliminate the need to repeat preferences or information in every conversation, making it more efficient for users. Examples include a teacher specifying lesson plan preferences, a developer requesting code in a specific language, and a shopper creating a grocery list for a large family. OpenAI acknowledges that during the beta period, the model may not always interpret custom instructions perfectly, and safety measures have been implemented to ensure compliance with usage policies and privacy protection.",
