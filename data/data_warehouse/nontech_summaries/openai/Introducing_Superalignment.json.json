    "title": "Introducing Superalignment",
    "summary": "OpenAI is assembling a team to tackle the problem of superintelligence alignment, which refers to ensuring that AI systems smarter than humans follow human intent. They aim to build an automated alignment researcher and develop new techniques to align superintelligence. The team will focus on training methods, validation, robustness, interpretability, and adversarial testing. They are dedicating 20% of their compute resources over the next four years to this problem and are actively seeking researchers and engineers to join their efforts. The goal is to solve the core technical challenges of superintelligence alignment in four years.",
