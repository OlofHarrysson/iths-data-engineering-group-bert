    "summary": "OpenAI recently embarked on a four-week trip to 25 cities across 6 continents to engage with users, developers, policymakers, and the public to understand their priorities for AI development and deployment. They found that users and developers are already building valuable applications using OpenAI tools, and there are common hopes and concerns regarding AI's impact. Policymakers are focused on ensuring safe and beneficial deployment of AI, and people want to know more about OpenAI's core values. OpenAI plans to make their products more useful and accessible, develop best practices for governing highly capable foundation models, and work to unlock AI's benefits.",
