    "title": "Governance of superintelligence",
    "summary": "The development of superintelligence in AI systems has the potential to exceed expert skill levels and carry out as much productive activity as large corporations within the next ten years. This technology poses both significant upsides and downsides, requiring careful risk management. Coordination among development efforts, international oversight, and technical safety measures are necessary to navigate this development successfully. Public input and democratic decision-making should play a role in governing the deployment and bounds of AI systems. Despite the risks and difficulties, building superintelligence is seen as necessary for a better world and stopping its creation would be challenging.",
