    "summary": "OpenAI has shared stories of how educators are using ChatGPT to enhance student learning. Some examples include using ChatGPT for role-playing challenging conversations, creating quizzes and lesson plans, assisting non-English speakers with translation, and teaching students about critical thinking. OpenAI also provides example prompts for educators to get started with ChatGPT, such as creating lesson plans, developing effective explanations, and acting as an AI tutor. It's important to remember that ChatGPT is a tool and may not always produce correct information, so educators should review and adapt the output accordingly.",
