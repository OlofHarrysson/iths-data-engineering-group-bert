    "title": "Using GPT-4 for content moderation",
    "summary": "OpenAI is exploring the use of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, for content moderation on digital platforms. This approach allows for faster iteration on policy changes, reducing the time from months to hours. GPT-4 can interpret and adapt to policy updates, resulting in more consistent labeling. The use of AI-assisted moderation can help relieve the burden on human moderators and create a more positive future for digital platforms. Anyone with access to the OpenAI API can implement this approach for their own content moderation system.",
