    "summary": "OpenAI has announced the availability of fine-tuning for its GPT-3.5 Turbo model, with fine-tuning for GPT-4 coming later this year. This update allows developers to customize the models for their specific use cases and achieve better performance. Early tests have shown that a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 Turbo can match or even outperform the capabilities of GPT-4 on certain tasks. Fine-tuning enables improved steerability, reliable output formatting, and custom tone. The data sent in and out of the fine-tuning API is owned by the customer and not used by OpenAI or any other organization for training other models.",
