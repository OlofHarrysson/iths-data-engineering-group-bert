    "summary": "OpenAI is launching a grant program to develop proof-of-concepts for a democratic process that can determine the rules AI systems should follow. The aim is to ensure that AI benefits all of humanity and is shaped to be as inclusive as possible. The program encourages innovative approaches to democratic processes, with a focus on transparency, public input, and deliberative discussions. The grant recipients will receive $100,000 to pilot their proposals and are expected to engage at least 500 participants and publish a public report on their findings.",
