    "title": "Partnership with American Journalism Project to support local news",
    "summary": "The American Journalism Project (AJP) has announced a partnership with OpenAI to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can support local news organizations. OpenAI will provide $5 million in funding to AJP and up to $5 million in API credits to help grantee organizations assess and deploy AI technologies. The collaboration aims to develop tools that can assist local news organizations and ensure that AI enhances journalism rather than imperils it. The partnership will also address challenges such as misinformation, bias, privacy, and copyright. AJP will use the funds to create a technology and AI studio, make pilot investments, and distribute API credits to its portfolio organizations.",
