    "title": "Partnership with American Journalism Project to support local news",
    "summary": "The American Journalism Project (AJP) has partnered with OpenAI to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can support local news organizations. OpenAI will provide $5 million in funding to AJP and up to $5 million in API credits to help AJP's grantee organizations assess and deploy emerging AI technologies. The collaboration aims to develop tools that can assist local news organizations and ensure that AI enhances journalism rather than imperils it. The partnership will also support AJP's efforts to rebuild local news and counter misinformation. AJP will create a technology and AI studio, make pilot investments, and utilize OpenAI's API credits to experiment with AI applications.",
