    "title": "Jackson Jewett wants to design buildings that use less concrete",
    "summary": "Jackson Jewett, a PhD student at MIT, is working on refining algorithms that can design building-scale concrete structures using less material, thereby reducing carbon emissions from the construction industry. His research focuses on topology optimization, which uses algorithms to design structures that meet performance requirements while using minimal material. Jewett's goal is to implement these ideas in real-world applications and inspire others to pursue sustainable construction methods. He also values the collaborative environment at MIT and plans to pursue a career in academia after completing his program.",
