    "title": "Gamifying medical data labeling to advance AI",
    "summary": "Erik Duhaime, a former MIT PhD student, founded Centaur Labs to gather the opinions of medical experts through their mobile app, DiagnosUs. Users review real-world scientific and biomedical data, such as images of skin lesions or audio clips of heart and lung sounds, and are rewarded with cash prizes for accurate opinions. These opinions help train and improve medical AI algorithms. The approach combines the desire of medical experts to improve their skills with the need for well-labeled medical data for AI companies. Centaur Labs' platform has been successful in producing accurate results and attracting users, including medical students and professionals. The company aims to be used as an ongoing check on AI models and believes that human judgment will continue to play a crucial role in the integration of humans and AI algorithms.",
