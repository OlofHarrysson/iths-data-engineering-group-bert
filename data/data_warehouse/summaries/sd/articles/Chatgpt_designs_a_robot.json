    "title": "Chatgpt designs a robot",
    "summary": "Researchers from TU Delft and EPFL collaborated with ChatGPT, an AI language model, to design a tomato-harvesting robot. ChatGPT provided valuable suggestions during the conceptual and implementation phases of the design process. However, the researchers also highlighted the risk of misinformation and bias in relying solely on AI input. They are continuing their study of AI language models to explore their role in assisting robot developers while maintaining creativity and innovation in robotics.",
