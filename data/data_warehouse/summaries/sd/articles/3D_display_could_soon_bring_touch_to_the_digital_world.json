    "title": "3D display could soon bring touch to the digital world",
    "summary": "Engineers from the University of Colorado Boulder have developed a shape-shifting display made of soft robotic \"muscles\" that can sense pressure and create patterns. The display has the potential to provide a sense of touch in the digital age. The technology, called Hydraulically Amplified Self-Healing ELectrostatic (HASEL) actuators, could be used in sensory gloves for virtual gaming or smart conveyer belts. The researchers are also working on increasing the resolution of the display and developing a glove that allows users to \"feel\" objects in virtual reality.",
