    "title": "Better than humans: Artificial intelligence in intensive care units",
    "summary": "Researchers at TU Wien have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses extensive data from intensive care units to provide treatment suggestions for patients with sepsis. The AI system, which uses reinforcement learning, has been found to surpass the quality of human decisions in terms of patient outcomes. However, the researchers highlight the need for discussions on the legal aspects of using AI in healthcare, including liability for mistakes and the right of healthcare professionals to ignore AI recommendations.",
