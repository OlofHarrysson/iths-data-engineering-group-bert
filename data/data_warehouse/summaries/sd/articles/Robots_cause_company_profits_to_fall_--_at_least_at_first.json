    "title": "Robots cause company profits to fall -- at least at first",
    "summary": "A study from the University of Cambridge found that the adoption of robots in industries has a U-shaped effect on profit margins. At low levels of adoption, robots have a negative impact on profits, but at higher levels, they can help increase profits. The researchers attribute this phenomenon to the initial focus on cost reduction and process innovation, which can be easily copied by competitors. However, as robots become fully integrated into a company's processes, they can be used to innovate new products and differentiate from competitors, leading to increased revenue. The study analyzed industry data from the UK and 24 other European countries between 1995 and 2017. The researchers also conducted interviews with a medical equipment manufacturer to understand their experiences with robot adoption. To reach the profitable side of the U-shaped curve more quickly, companies need to adapt their business models concurrently with robot adoption. The research was supported by UK Research and Innovation.",
