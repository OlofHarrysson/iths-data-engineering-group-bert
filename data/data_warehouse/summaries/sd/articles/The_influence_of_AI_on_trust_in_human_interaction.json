    "title": "The influence of AI on trust in human interaction",
    "summary": "Researchers from the University of Gothenburg have explored the issue of trust and conversational agents in an article titled \"Suspicious Minds: The Problem of Trust and Conversational Agents.\" They found that people often take a long time to realize they are interacting with an AI system, leading to potential negative consequences such as excessive suspicion. The researchers suggest that AI should have synthetic voices that are clearly distinguishable from human voices to increase transparency. The uncertainty of whether one is talking to a human or a computer can impact communication and relationships. The study analyzed data from YouTube videos featuring interactions between robots, humans, and telemarketers.",
