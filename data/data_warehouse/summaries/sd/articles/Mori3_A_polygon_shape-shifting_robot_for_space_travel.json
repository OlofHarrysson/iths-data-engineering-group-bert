    "title": "Mori3: A polygon shape-shifting robot for space travel",
    "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed a modular robot called Mori3 that can morph from 2D triangles into various 3D objects. The robot's individual triangular modules easily join together to create different shapes and sizes through a process called polygon meshing. The Mori3 robot is versatile and can change its size, shape, and function depending on the task at hand. The researchers believe that this modular and multi-functional robot could be used in space travel for tasks such as communication and external repairs.",
