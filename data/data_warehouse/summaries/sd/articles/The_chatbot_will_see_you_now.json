    "title": "The chatbot will see you now",
    "summary": "Researchers from the University of California Irvine, Children's National Hospital, and Invitae Corporation have developed a chatbot called GIA to obtain informed consent for medical research. The chatbot was able to quiz participants to assess their knowledge and could be accessed at any time, making it more convenient for individuals with limited free time. The researchers found that the chatbot reduced the time and length of the consent process compared to traditional methods. Participants also reported a positive experience and high levels of understanding. The researchers believe that the chatbot could be used in different languages to reach global populations and improve the process of obtaining informed consent.",
