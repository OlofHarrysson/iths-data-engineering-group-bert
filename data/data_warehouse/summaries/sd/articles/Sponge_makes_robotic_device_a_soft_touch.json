    "title": "Sponge makes robotic device a soft touch",
    "summary": "Researchers have developed a sponge-jamming device that can give robots the ability to handle delicate items with a human-like touch. The device, made from a silicone sponge, can vary its stiffness to safely grip objects such as eggs. The low-cost and lightweight device has potential applications in industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. The researchers are now working on expanding the device's capabilities to achieve variable stiffness in multiple directions.",
