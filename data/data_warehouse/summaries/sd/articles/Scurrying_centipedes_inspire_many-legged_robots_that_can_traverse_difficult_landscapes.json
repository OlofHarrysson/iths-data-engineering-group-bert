    "title": "Scurrying centipedes inspire many-legged robots that can traverse difficult landscapes",
    "summary": "Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a theory of multilegged locomotion and created many-legged robotic models that can move across uneven surfaces without additional sensing or control technology. The robots have the potential to be used in agriculture, space exploration, and search and rescue. The researchers found that adding leg pairs to the robot increases its ability to move robustly over challenging surfaces, a concept they call spatial redundancy. The robots can transport themselves and even a load from one point to another on difficult or \"noisy\" landscapes without the need for sensors to interpret the environment. The researchers are now applying their discoveries to farming and are working on determining the optimal number of legs for cost-effective and efficient motion.",
