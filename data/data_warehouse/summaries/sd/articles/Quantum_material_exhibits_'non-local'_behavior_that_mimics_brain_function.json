    "title": "Quantum material exhibits 'non-local' behavior that mimics brain function",
    "summary": "The Quantum Materials for Energy Efficient Neuromorphic Computing (Q-MEEN-C) consortium, led by the University of California San Diego, is working on creating brain-like computers with minimal energy requirements. In their research, they have successfully created or mimicked the properties of a single brain element using quantum materials. They have also discovered non-locality, where electrical stimuli passed between neighboring electrodes can affect non-neighboring electrodes, which is a crucial milestone in developing neuromorphic computing devices. The team has developed a device using a thin film of nickelate that can remember perturbations and create more conductive pathways. This design concept simplifies circuitry and allows for complex layers of learning, similar to how the brain functions. The researchers aim to revolutionize hardware in artificial intelligence to support advanced software capabilities.",
