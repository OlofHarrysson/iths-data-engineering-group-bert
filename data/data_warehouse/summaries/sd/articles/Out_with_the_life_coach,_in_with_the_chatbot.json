    "title": "Out with the life coach, in with the chatbot",
    "summary": "A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by researchers at the University of South Australia has found that chatbots can effectively improve physical activity, diet, and sleep. The study showed that chatbots can increase daily steps, encourage the consumption of fruits and vegetables, and improve sleep duration and quality. These findings highlight the potential of artificial intelligence to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Text-based chatbots were found to be more effective than speech-based AI, and the study showed that chatbots were effective across different age groups. However, a blended approach of chatbots and human coaching may be the most beneficial. While chatbots offer personalized and interactive support, caution is needed as there is potential for inappropriate advice. Using chatbots to supplement human coaching could be the best solution, as it combines the unique value of a human coach with round-the-clock support from a chatbot. Overall, chatbots have the potential to address modifiable factors in lifestyle diseases and alleviate pressure on the healthcare system.",
