    "title": "AI model can help determine where a patient\u2019s cancer arose",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have developed a computational model that uses machine learning to predict the origin of tumors in cancer patients. By analyzing the genetic sequences of about 400 genes, the model was able to accurately classify at least 40% of tumors of unknown origin. This approach could potentially guide doctors towards personalized treatments for patients with cancers of unknown primary origin, increasing the number of patients eligible for targeted treatments. The researchers hope to expand the model to include other types of data and provide a more comprehensive prediction.",
