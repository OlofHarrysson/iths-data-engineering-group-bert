    "title": "A new way to look at data privacy",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed a technique called Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Privacy, which allows for the addition of minimal noise to machine-learning models in order to protect sensitive data. The researchers created a privacy metric based on PAC Privacy that automatically determines the optimal amount of noise to add, without requiring knowledge of the model's inner workings or training process. This approach reduces the amount of noise needed compared to other methods, while still maintaining accuracy. The algorithm relies on the uncertainty or entropy of the original data to find the optimal amount of noise. However, PAC Privacy does not provide information on the accuracy loss caused by the added noise and can be computationally expensive. The researchers suggest improving the stability of the machine-learning training process to reduce the need for multiple runs of the algorithm and to minimize the amount of noise required.",
