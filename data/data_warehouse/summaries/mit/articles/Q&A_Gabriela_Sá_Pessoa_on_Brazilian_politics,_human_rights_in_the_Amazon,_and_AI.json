    "summary": "Gabriela S\u00e1 Pessoa, a journalist from Brazil, is passionate about human rights and climate change. She has worked for The Washington Post, Folha de S.Paulo, and UOL, covering topics such as the Amazon, human rights violations, and environmental crimes. She was awarded the 2023 Elizabeth Neuffer Fellowship, which supports her research at MIT and further training at The Boston Globe and The New York Times. S\u00e1 Pessoa emphasizes the importance of reporting on deforestation in the Amazon, as it is a global issue that requires awareness and action from individuals and governments. She discusses the challenges and changes expected with the new Lula administration in Brazil, particularly in relation to environmental policies. S\u00e1 Pessoa is currently learning about pressing issues at MIT and how to incorporate a scientific approach into her journalism. She also highlights the discussions and concerns surrounding artificial intelligence and the need for regulations and guardrails. After MIT, she will be interning at The New York Times and hopes to continue her research on carbon credit markets. S\u00e1 Pessoa is inspired to continue studying and potentially return to academia, particularly at MIT.",
