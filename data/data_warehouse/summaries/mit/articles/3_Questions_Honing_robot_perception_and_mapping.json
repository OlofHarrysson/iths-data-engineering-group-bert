    "title": "3 Questions: Honing robot perception and mapping",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed an open-source library called Kimera that allows robots to construct real-time 3D maps of their environment and label objects. The team has also created Kimera-Multi, which enables multiple robots to communicate and create a unified map. The system aims to improve consistency and redundancy in mapping tasks, as well as potentially reducing the time taken to complete tasks. The researchers are working on developing a more sophisticated understanding of the environment, including hierarchical representations and complex relationships between objects. The technology has potential applications in autonomous vehicles, search and rescue missions, and flexible factories.",
