    "title": "3 Questions: Honing robot perception and mapping",
    "summary": "Carlone and How are working on a new kind of robot that will be able to see the world in three-dimensional form. They're using Kimera, a library of open-source code, to build a system that allows multiple robots to work together to create an accurate map of their environment. The goal of this new system is to make sure that all the robots can communicate in the same way, which means that they won't have to worry about redundancy since they don't know each other very well. Carlone also talks about how he's learned a lot from his recent experiments with eight different robots at MIT. He tells us that one of the biggest challenges for them is that there's no way they can get along without sharing too much information. This is why they're building a 3D mesh or a map so that they can still understand the world around them. It's not yet clear what applications these new technologies might lead to, but Carlone thinks it's likely that autonomous vehicles will use these new kinds of technology to improve their maps.",
