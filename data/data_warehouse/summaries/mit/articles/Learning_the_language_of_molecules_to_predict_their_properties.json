    "title": "Learning the language of molecules to predict their properties",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab have developed a new machine learning framework that can predict molecular properties and generate new molecules more efficiently than existing approaches. The system uses a molecular grammar to understand the rules of how building blocks combine to form valid molecules, allowing it to predict properties and generate viable molecules with only a small amount of data. The system outperformed other machine learning approaches on both small and large datasets, and has the potential to accelerate the discovery of new materials and drugs.",
