    "title": "Understanding viral justice",
    "summary": "Scholar Ruha Benjamin argues that justice can be contagious, just like a virus. She encourages people to notice the ways exclusion is built into daily life, such as discriminatory design in public spaces. Benjamin also highlights the biases and inequities present in technology and calls for the creation of alternatives. She founded the Ida B. Wells Just Data Lab to address racial inequality in data and sees the next generation re-imagining technology to meet the needs of marginalized communities. Benjamin believes that by recognizing and addressing inequities, society can create new patterns and practices that undo systemic problems.",
