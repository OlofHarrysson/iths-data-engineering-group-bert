    "summary": "MIT students participated in the Envisioning the Future of Computing Prize, an essay contest that challenged them to imagine how advances in computing could transform society. The competition received nearly 60 submissions from students majoring in various fields. The winning entry, written by Robert Cunningham, explored the implications of a personalized language model that predicts an individual's writing based on their past texts and emails. Two other finalists were also awarded prizes for their essays on using reinforcement learning with human feedback and automatic fact checkers. The competition aimed to encourage students to think about the societal benefits and costs of technology.",
