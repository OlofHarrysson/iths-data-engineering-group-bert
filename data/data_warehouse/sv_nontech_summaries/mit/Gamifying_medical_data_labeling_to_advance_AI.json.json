    "summary": "Erik Duhaime, a former MIT student, founded Centaur Labs, a company that created the mobile app DiagnosUs. The app gathers the opinions of medical experts on real-world scientific and biomedical data, such as images of skin lesions or audio clips of heart and lung sounds. Users who provide accurate opinions are awarded small cash prizes. The app helps medical AI companies train and improve their algorithms by providing well-labeled medical data. Centaur Labs' approach combines the desire of medical experts to improve their skills with the need for labeled medical data by AI companies.",
