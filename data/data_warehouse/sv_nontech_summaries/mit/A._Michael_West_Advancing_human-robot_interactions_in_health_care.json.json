    "summary": "A. Michael West, a PhD candidate in mechanical engineering at MIT, discusses how he stumbled into his career path and his experiences in the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP). He credits MSRP with giving him the confidence to pursue graduate studies and the opportunity to connect with a diverse community of scientists. West's current research focuses on understanding human movement and applying that knowledge to robotics and rehabilitation. He has received prestigious fellowships and will soon begin a fellowship with the MIT and Accenture Convergence Initiative for Industry and Technology. Despite his success, West remains laid-back and emphasizes the importance of asking for help.",
