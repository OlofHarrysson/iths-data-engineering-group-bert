    "title": "Jackson Jewett wants to design buildings that use less concrete",
    "summary": "Jackson Jewett, a former biking tour guide, has embarked on a PhD program at MIT to study topology optimization in concrete design. His research aims to develop algorithms that can design building-scale concrete structures using less material, thereby reducing carbon emissions from the construction industry. Jewett's work is part of a broader effort to combat climate change by implementing sustainable practices in the built environment. He is also involved in teaching and mentoring undergraduate students at MIT and plans to pursue a career in academia after completing his program.",
