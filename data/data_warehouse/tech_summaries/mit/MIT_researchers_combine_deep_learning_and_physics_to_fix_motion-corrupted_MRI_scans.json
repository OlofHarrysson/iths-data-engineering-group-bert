    "title": "MIT researchers combine deep learning and physics to fix motion-corrupted MRI scans",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed a deep learning model that can correct motion artifacts in brain MRI scans. MRI scans are highly sensitive to motion, which can result in image artifacts and potentially lead to misdiagnoses or inappropriate treatment. The new method computationally constructs a motion-free image from motion-corrupted data without changing the scanning procedure. This approach ensures consistency between the image output and the actual measurements, improving diagnostic accuracy. The ability to obtain motion artifact-free MRI scans would benefit patients with neurological disorders and reduce healthcare costs. Future work may explore motion correction in other body parts and more sophisticated types of head motion.",
