    "title": "A new dataset of Arctic images will spur artificial intelligence research",
    "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Healy is capturing images of the Arctic to study the rapidly changing region. A camera system installed on the ship will create a dataset that can be used to develop artificial intelligence tools for analyzing Arctic imagery. The dataset will help mariners navigate safely, protect national security, and understand the changing climate, wildlife, and geography of the Arctic. The camera system, called CRISP, includes a long-wave infrared camera that can operate in harsh maritime environments. The dataset, expected to be about 4 terabytes, will be publicly released for wider research and development.",
