    "title": "New model offers a way to speed up drug discovery",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT and Tufts University have developed a computational approach, called ConPLex, that uses a large language model to match target proteins with potential drug molecules without calculating the molecules' structures. This approach allows for the screening of more than 100 million compounds in a single day, making it more efficient than existing methods. The researchers trained the model on known protein-drug interactions and incorporated a training stage to distinguish between real drugs and decoys. Experimental testing showed strong binding affinity between the selected drug-protein pairs. This approach has the potential to reduce the cost and failure rates of drug discovery.",
