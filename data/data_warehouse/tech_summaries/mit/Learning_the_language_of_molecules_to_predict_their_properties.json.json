    "title": "Learning the language of molecules to predict their properties",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab have developed a new machine learning framework that can predict molecular properties and generate new molecules more efficiently than existing approaches. The system uses a molecular grammar to understand the rules of how building blocks combine to form valid molecules, allowing it to predict properties and generate new molecules with limited data. The framework outperformed other approaches on both small and large datasets, and has potential applications beyond chemistry and material science.",
