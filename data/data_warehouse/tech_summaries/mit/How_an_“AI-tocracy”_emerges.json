    "title": "How an \u201cAI-tocracy\u201d emerges",
    "summary": "A new study led by an MIT professor suggests that authoritarian regimes, such as China, are using AI-driven facial recognition technology to suppress dissent and limit protests. The research found that increased deployment of this technology leads to greater government procurement of AI, which in turn stimulates further innovation. The study analyzed data on political unrest in China and government procurement contracts for facial recognition AI services. It concluded that the technology effectively suppresses dissent and drives innovation in the country's tech sector. The findings highlight how autocratic governments can enhance their political power by harnessing technological advances. However, the study does not contradict previous research showing that democratic institutions generate greater economic growth over time. The researchers are also examining the global export of facial recognition technology by China.",
