    "title": "System combines light and electrons to unlock faster, greener computing",
    "summary": "MIT researchers have developed a photonic-electronic reconfigurable SmartNIC called \"Lightning\" that uses photonics to accelerate machine learning. The system combines the speed of photonics with the dataflow control capabilities of electronic computers, allowing for real-time machine learning inference tasks. The researchers solved the challenge of dataflow control between photonics and electronics by creating a count-action programming abstraction that acts as a unified language between the two. Lightning is more energy-efficient and faster than traditional accelerators, making it a potential solution for reducing carbon footprints in data centers.",
