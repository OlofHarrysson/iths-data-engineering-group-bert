    "title": "Using AI, scientists find a drug that could combat drug-resistant infections",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT and McMaster University have used an artificial intelligence algorithm to identify a new antibiotic that can kill drug-resistant bacteria. The antibiotic, called abaucin, has shown promise in treating infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii, a bacteria commonly found in hospitals. The researchers trained a machine-learning model to evaluate chemical compounds for their ability to inhibit the growth of A. baumannii, and the model identified abaucin as a potential candidate. The drug works by interfering with lipoprotein trafficking, a process involved in transporting proteins within cells. The researchers are now working to optimize the compound for use in patients.",
