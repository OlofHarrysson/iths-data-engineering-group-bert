    "title": "SMART launches research group to advance AI, automation, and the future of work",
    "summary": "The Singapore MIT-Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) has launched a new interdisciplinary research group called Mens, Manus and Machina: How AI Empowers People, Institutions and the City in Singapore (M3S). The group aims to tackle social and institutional challenges related to artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies. M3S will focus on the human-machine relationship, enhancing existing AI initiatives in Singapore, and advancing knowledge in AI, automation, and robotics. The project is supported by a multimillion-dollar grant from the National Research Foundation of Singapore. The research will be conducted by a diverse team of professors from MIT and institutions in Singapore. The group will explore topics such as physical and digital interfaces between humans and machines, machine learning, and the implications of AI for human and social capital development. The goal is to design inclusive, resilient, and innovative solutions that empower individuals, institutions, and cities. The research conducted by M3S could significantly advance areas such as soft robotics, brain interfaces, learning algorithms, and sustainable technology. The impact of AI on human welfare and productivity is a central consideration for the group. The collaboration between MIT and Singapore aims to break new ground in understanding AI's impact on the future of work and turn technological advancements into engines for human potential and societal progress. SMART M3S hopes to enhance Singapore's ability to create forward-looking AI policies, invigorate its economic standing within AI, and support local workforce training and mentorship on AI topics.",
