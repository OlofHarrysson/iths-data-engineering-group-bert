    "title": "How machine-learning models can amplify inequities in medical diagnosis and treatment",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT have explored the issue of biases in machine learning models used in healthcare. They identified four types of biases that can arise in machine learning models: spurious correlations, attribute imbalance, class imbalance, and attribute generalization. The researchers found that improving the classifier layer of the neural network reduced spurious correlations and class imbalance, while improving the encoder layer reduced attribute imbalance. However, they were unable to find a solution for attribute generalization. The researchers also discovered that boosting worst-group accuracy led to a decrease in worst-case precision, highlighting the need to balance accuracy and precision in medical diagnostics. The ultimate goal of the research is to achieve fairness in healthcare for all populations.",
