    "title": "A step toward safe and reliable autopilots for flying",
    "summary": "MIT researchers have developed a new machine-learning technique that can solve complex stabilize-avoid problems better than existing methods. The technique uses a two-step approach, reframing the problem as a constrained optimization problem and then solving it using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. The researchers tested their approach by successfully piloting a simulated jet aircraft through a narrow corridor without crashing. This technique could be applied to designing controllers for autonomous delivery drones or as part of larger systems for mission-critical applications. The researchers plan to enhance the technique to account for uncertainty and test it on hardware.",
