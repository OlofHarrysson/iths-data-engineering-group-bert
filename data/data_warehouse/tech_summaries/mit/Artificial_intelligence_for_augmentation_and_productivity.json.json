    "summary": "The MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing has awarded seed grants to seven projects that aim to enhance modern workspaces using artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction. The projects, funded by Dropbox Inc., will bring together researchers from computing, social sciences, and management. The projects include implementing Vannevar Bush's vision of the Memex using large language models, simulating social scenarios using AI agents, and exploring how AI can complement human decision-making. Other projects focus on generative AI in hospitals, democratizing programming, understanding the impact of AI on skill acquisition and productivity, and developing AI-powered onboarding and support systems.",
