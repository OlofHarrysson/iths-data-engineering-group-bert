    "title": "A new dataset of Arctic images will spur artificial intelligence research",
    "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Healy is capturing images of the Arctic during a three-month science mission to develop artificial intelligence tools for analyzing Arctic imagery. The dataset will help mariners navigate safely, improve maritime domain awareness, and understand the changing Arctic environment. The camera system, called CRISP, was installed on the Healy and includes a long-wave infrared camera that can operate in harsh maritime conditions. The dataset, expected to be about 4 terabytes in size, will be publicly released to enable the wider research community to develop better tools for operating in the Arctic.",
