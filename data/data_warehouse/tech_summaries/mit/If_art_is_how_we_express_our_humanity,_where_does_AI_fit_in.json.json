    "title": "If art is how we express our humanity, where does AI fit in?",
    "summary": "A group of researchers from MIT has published a commentary article in Science, highlighting the immediate impact of generative AI on creative work and society. They emphasize the need for discussions about the human role in creative production and the potential job displacement caused by AI. The researchers also address the complexity of black-box AI systems and the need for transparency in understanding their impacts. They identify gaps in research around generative AI and art, including perceptions of the generative process, ownership and credit issues, labor economics, and the effect on the media ecosystem. The researchers hope to start a conversation and build a roadmap for understanding the fast-moving AI landscape.",
