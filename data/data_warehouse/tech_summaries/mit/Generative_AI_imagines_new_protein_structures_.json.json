    "title": "Generative AI imagines new protein structures ",
    "summary": "MIT CSAIL researchers have developed a computational tool called \"FrameDiff\" that uses machine learning to create new protein structures. By generating \"frames\" that align with the properties of protein structures, the tool can construct novel proteins independently of preexisting designs. This advancement in protein engineering has implications for drug development, diagnostics, biotechnology, and more. The researchers also collaborated with the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington to create \"RFdiffusion,\" a tool that combines SE(3) diffusion with protein structure prediction to solve crucial problems in biotechnology. The team aims to further improve FrameDiff's generality and expand its training to include DNA and small molecules.",
