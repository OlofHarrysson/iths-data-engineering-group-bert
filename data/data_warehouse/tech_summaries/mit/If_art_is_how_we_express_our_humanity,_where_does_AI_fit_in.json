    "title": "If art is how we express our humanity, where does AI fit in?",
    "summary": "A group of researchers from MIT have published a commentary article in Science discussing the immediate impact of generative AI on creative work and society. They highlight the need for discussions about the human role in creative production and the potential dangers of AI, such as disinformation and job displacement. The researchers also emphasize the importance of understanding the generative process, addressing issues of ownership and credit, and considering the impact on aesthetics, culture, labor, and the media ecosystem. They hope that their paper will contribute to a more comprehensive and informed conversation about AI and its implications.",
