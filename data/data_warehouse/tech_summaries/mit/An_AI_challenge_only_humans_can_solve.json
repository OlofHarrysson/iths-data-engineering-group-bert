    "title": "An AI challenge only humans can solve",
    "summary": "MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson argue in their new book, \"Power and Progress: Our 1000-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity,\" that the current path of artificial intelligence (AI) is detrimental to both the economy and democracy. They believe that AI should be designed to be useful to people rather than replacing them, and that it should focus on creating marginal productivity gains that compel firms to hire more workers. The authors also express concerns about the use of AI in surveillance, data collection, and misinformation, and advocate for policy responses to address these issues. They emphasize the need for broader public discussion and control over the development and use of technology.",
