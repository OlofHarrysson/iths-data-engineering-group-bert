    "title": "Making life friendlier with personal robots",
    "summary": "Sharifa Alghowinem, a research scientist in MIT's Personal Robots Group, has been working on developing robots that can understand and explain human emotions. She has been collaborating with Jibo, a friendly robot companion, to explore the potential for companion robots to go beyond transactional commands and become insightful coaches and companions. Alghowinem's research has focused on mental health care and education, using Jibo to coach and support individuals based on their verbal and non-verbal responses. She envisions Jibo becoming a companion for the whole household, playing a role in emotional wellness and even acting as a confidential resource or mental health coach. Alghowinem is also passionate about teaching and mentoring others, and is working on a project to use social robots to teach English and social-emotional skills to refugee children from Syria.",
