    "title": "Understanding viral justice",
    "summary": "Ruha Benjamin, a scholar who studies the social dimensions of science, medicine, and technology, argues that justice can be contagious, just like a virus. She encourages people to notice the ways exclusion is built into daily life, such as discriminatory design in public spaces. Benjamin also highlights the hidden biases in new technologies and coined the term \"the New Jim Code\" to describe the combination of coded bias and the perceived objectivity of technology. She emphasizes the importance of calling out these harms and creating alternatives, and cites initiatives like the Data for Black Lives movement and the Detroit Community Technology Project as examples of people re-imagining the digital ecosystem. Benjamin founded the Ida B. Wells Just Data Lab to develop a critical and creative approach to data that addresses racial inequality. She believes that by re-imagining technology and weaving new patterns, practices, and politics, we can undo the vast problems of inequity in society.",
