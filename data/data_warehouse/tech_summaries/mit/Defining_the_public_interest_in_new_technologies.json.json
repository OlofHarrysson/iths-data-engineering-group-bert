    "title": "Defining the public interest in new technologies",
    "summary": "The emergence of disruptive technologies, including advanced artificial intelligence systems, is changing the way we work, live, and play. It is important for academics, practitioners, innovators, and entrepreneurs to pursue pathways that ensure marginalized populations benefit from these technologies. Professional training is needed to address the ethical and moral dilemmas associated with technology development. Creators of new technologies have a responsibility to consider the potential adverse societal consequences. Public interest technology is an emerging field that focuses on the social responsibilities of technologists. MIT's Public Interest Technologist (TPIT) publication aims to foster conversations and define best practices in this field. The TPIT editorial team invites the MIT community to contribute to the discussion and attend the PIT-UN annual meeting.",
