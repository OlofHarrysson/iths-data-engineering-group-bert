    "title": "Autonomous innovations in an uncertain world",
    "summary": "MIT Professor Jonathan How and his team have developed a trajectory planning system that allows a fleet of drones to operate in the same airspace without colliding with each other. The system uses distributed robust planning algorithms to coordinate the drones and a \"perception aware\" function that allows each drone to gather new information about the others and alter its trajectory accordingly. The algorithm has a 100% success rate in avoiding collisions. The next step is to scale up the algorithms and test them in larger spaces. The system has implications for industries such as agriculture and defense.",
