    "title": "Three Spanish MIT physics postdocs receive Botton Foundation fellowships",
    "summary": "The Mauricio and Carlota Botton Foundation has chosen three Spanish MIT postdocs as its first cohort of fellows. The recipients, Luis Antonio Ben\u00edtez, Carolina Cuesta-Lazaro, and Fernando Romero L\u00f3pez, will receive a one-year stipend and research fund to pursue their research interests. Ben\u00edtez focuses on the electronic properties of quantum materials, Cuesta-Lazaro combines cosmology and artificial intelligence, and Romero-L\u00f3pez studies strong interactions among quarks and gluons. The foundation also funded scholarships for two PhD physics students at MIT. The foundation supports scientific research and the training of young physicists.",
