    "title": "A new way to look at data privacy",
    "summary": "MIT researchers have developed a technique called Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Privacy that can determine the minimal amount of noise needed to protect sensitive data in machine-learning models. The researchers created a privacy metric based on PAC Privacy that focuses on the difficulty an adversary would have in reconstructing sensitive data after noise has been added. The algorithm automatically determines the optimal amount of noise to add, guaranteeing privacy even if the adversary has infinite computing power. This technique does not require knowledge of the model's inner workings and can be used for different types of models and applications.",
