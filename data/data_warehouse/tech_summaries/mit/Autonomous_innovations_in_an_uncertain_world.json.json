    "title": "Autonomous innovations in an uncertain world",
    "summary": "MIT Professor Jonathan How is focused on developing distributed robust planning algorithms to coordinate multiple autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. His research includes a trajectory planning system for drones to operate in the same airspace without colliding, as well as collecting real-time data from autonomous cars to track pedestrians and improve decision-making. How also uses fast-to-query neural networks trained to imitate computationally expensive optimizers for real-time decision-making in aircraft. He collaborates with industry partners to solve real-world problems and transition his algorithms back to the industry.",
