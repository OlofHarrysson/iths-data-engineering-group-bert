    "title": "Machine-learning system based on light could yield more powerful, efficient large language models",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed a new system that uses light instead of electrons to perform machine-learning computations, potentially making machine-learning programs significantly more powerful and energy-efficient. The system, which utilizes hundreds of micron-scale lasers, demonstrated a 100-fold improvement in energy efficiency and a 25-fold improvement in compute density compared to state-of-the-art digital computers. The researchers believe that this technology could enable large-scale optoelectronic processors in the future, allowing small devices like cellphones to run programs that currently require large data centers. The components of the system can be created using existing fabrication processes, making commercial scalability feasible within a few years. The researchers have filed for a patent on the technology.",
