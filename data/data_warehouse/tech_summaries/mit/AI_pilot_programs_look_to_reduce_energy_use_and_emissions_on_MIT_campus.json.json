    "title": "AI pilot programs look to reduce energy use and emissions on MIT campus",
    "summary": "MIT researchers are using artificial intelligence (AI) to develop smarter building controls that can dynamically manage the heating and cooling of an entire campus. By using AI algorithms that respond in real-time to factors such as occupancy fluctuations, weather forecasts, and grid carbon intensity, the researchers aim to optimize temperature set points and reduce energy consumption. The project, which started with pilots in classrooms, has the potential to achieve significant energy savings across the entire campus and contribute to MIT's decarbonization goals. The researchers are also exploring the possibility of creating a virtual energy network using aggregated thermostats to further optimize energy use.",
