    "title": "AI pilot programs look to reduce energy use and emissions on MIT campus",
    "summary": "MIT researchers are using artificial intelligence (AI) to develop smart building controls that can optimize heating and cooling in campus buildings. The AI system takes into account factors such as occupancy patterns, weather forecasts, and the carbon intensity of the grid to determine the optimal temperature set points for individual rooms. The goal is to reduce energy consumption while maintaining thermal comfort. The project is currently being piloted in classrooms, with plans to expand to other spaces and buildings on campus. The researchers estimate significant energy savings and hope to scale up the technology to make a big impact at MIT.",
