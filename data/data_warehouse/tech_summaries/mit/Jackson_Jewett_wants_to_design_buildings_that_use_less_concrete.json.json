    "title": "Jackson Jewett wants to design buildings that use less concrete",
    "summary": "Jackson Jewett, a former biking tour leader, decided to pursue his passion for buildings and the built environment. With a background in cognitive science and a minor in history of architecture, Jewett joined MIT's master's program in civil and environmental engineering. He collaborated with Josephine Carstensen on topology optimization, using algorithms to design concrete structures that use less material and reduce carbon emissions. Jewett is now in his third year of his PhD program, refining algorithms for building-scale concrete structures. He aims to implement his ideas and make a tangible impact in the fight against climate change. Jewett also enjoys teaching and plans to pursue a career in academia after completing his program. He values the collaborative environment at MIT but acknowledges the pressure and emphasizes the importance of mental health resources.",
