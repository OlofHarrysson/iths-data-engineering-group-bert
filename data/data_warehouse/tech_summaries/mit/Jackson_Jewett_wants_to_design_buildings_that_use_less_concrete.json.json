    "title": "Jackson Jewett wants to design buildings that use less concrete",
    "summary": "Jackson Jewett, a former biking tour leader, decided to pursue his passion for buildings and the built environment. With a background in cognitive science and a minor in history of architecture, Jewett joined MIT's civil and environmental engineering program. He collaborated with Josephine Carstensen on topology optimization, using algorithms to design concrete structures that use less material and reduce carbon emissions. Jewett's PhD research focuses on refining these algorithms to design building-scale concrete structures. He also works as a teaching assistant and plans to pursue a career in academia after completing his program.",
