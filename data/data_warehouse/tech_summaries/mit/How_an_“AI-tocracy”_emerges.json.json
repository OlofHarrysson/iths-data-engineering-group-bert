    "title": "How an \u201cAI-tocracy\u201d emerges",
    "summary": "A new study led by an MIT professor suggests that authoritarian regimes, such as China, can use AI-driven facial recognition technology to suppress dissent and stimulate innovation. The study found that regions with more unrest in China led to greater government procurement of facial recognition AI, which in turn stimulated further innovation. The researchers also found that the technology effectively suppressed dissent and drove the country's tech sector forward. The findings highlight how autocratic governments can enhance their political power by harnessing technological advances. The study does not contradict previous research on the benefits of democratic institutions for economic growth but identifies an avenue through which authoritarian governments can generate more growth.",
