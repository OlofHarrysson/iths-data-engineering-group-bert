    "title": "A pose-mapping technique could remotely evaluate patients with cerebral palsy",
    "summary": "MIT engineers have developed a method that uses computer vision and machine learning to remotely evaluate patients' motor function. The method analyzes videos of patients in real-time and computes a clinical score based on patterns of poses detected in the video frames. The researchers tested the method on videos of over 1,000 children with cerebral palsy and found that it matched the clinical scores determined by clinicians with over 70% accuracy. The team envisions that patients can use their mobile devices to record videos of themselves at home, which can then be analyzed and sent to doctors for review. The researchers are also working on adapting the method to evaluate other neurological disorders.",
