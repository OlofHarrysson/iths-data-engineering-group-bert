    "title": "Gamifying medical data labeling to advance AI",
    "summary": "Centaur Labs, founded by Erik Duhaime, has developed a mobile app called DiagnosUs that gathers the opinions of medical experts on real-world scientific and biomedical data. Users of the app review images or audio clips related to medical conditions and are awarded cash prizes for accurate opinions. These opinions help train and improve medical AI algorithms. The approach combines the desire of medical experts to improve their skills with the need for well-labeled medical data by AI companies. Centaur Labs aims to be a part of the ongoing check on AI models and provide human judgment in the integration of humans and AI algorithms.",
