    "title": "Defining the public interest in new technologies",
    "summary": "The emergence of disruptive technologies, such as advanced artificial intelligence systems, is changing the way we work, live, and play. There is a need for academics, practitioners, innovators, and entrepreneurs to focus on ensuring that the benefits of these technologies uplift marginalized populations. Professional training is necessary to achieve this goal. The creators of new technologies have a responsibility to consider the potential adverse societal consequences of their products. Public interest technology is a new field that aims to shift the focus from technologies to the technologists and promote ethical practices. The Public Interest Technologist (TPIT) is an online publication launched by MIT to discuss the social responsibilities of individuals involved in technology design and evaluation. The publication seeks to foster conversations and involve the MIT community in shaping its content. A coalition of universities, including MIT, is working together to share ideas about public interest technology and organize events. The TPIT editorial team encourages community involvement and invites nominations, article suggestions, and published materials to support the discussion of public interest technology.",
