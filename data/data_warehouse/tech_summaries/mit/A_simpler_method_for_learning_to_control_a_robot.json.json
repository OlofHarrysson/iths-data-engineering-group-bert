    "title": "A simpler method for learning to control a robot",
    "summary": "Researchers from MIT and Stanford University have developed a machine-learning approach that can be used to control robots, such as drones or autonomous vehicles, more effectively in dynamic environments. The approach incorporates structure from control theory into the learning process, allowing for the creation of controllers that function more effectively in the real world. The technique extracts an effective controller directly from the learned model, resulting in better performance and requiring less data. The approach is general and can be applied to various types of dynamical systems.",
