    "title": "OpenAI partners with Scale to provide support for enterprises fine-tuning models",
    "summary": "OpenAI and Scale have partnered to offer fine-tuning capabilities for OpenAI's advanced models. This allows companies to customize the models on proprietary data, making them more useful. Data sent in and out of the fine-tuning API is owned by the customer and not used by OpenAI or any other organization. Scale, as a preferred partner, will help extend the benefits of fine-tuning by leveraging their expertise in data enrichment and model evaluation. Scale has already demonstrated the value of fine-tuning by working with Brex to fine-tune GPT-3.5.",
