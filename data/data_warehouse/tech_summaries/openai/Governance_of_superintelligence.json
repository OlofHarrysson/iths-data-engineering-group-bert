    "title": "Governance of superintelligence",
    "summary": "OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research lab, has outlined its initial thinking on the governance of superintelligence. The lab believes that coordination among leading development efforts is necessary to ensure the safe and smooth integration of superintelligence systems into society. It also suggests the need for an international authority, similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency, to regulate superintelligence efforts above a certain capability threshold. Additionally, OpenAI emphasises the importance of developing the technical capability to make superintelligence safe. The lab believes that public oversight and democratic decision-making should play a role in governing the most powerful AI systems.",
