    "summary": "OpenAI recently embarked on a four-week trip to 25 cities across 6 continents to engage with users, developers, policymakers, and the public to understand their priorities for AI development and deployment. They found that users and developers are already building valuable applications using OpenAI tools. Common hopes and concerns for AI's impact include expanding access to education and healthcare, boosting economic growth, and addressing safety and security risks. Policymakers are focused on ensuring safe and beneficial AI deployment and are supportive of a global framework to manage powerful future AI systems. OpenAI is committed to making their products more useful and accessible, developing best practices for governing highly capable foundation models, and unlocking AI's benefits through AI literacy and support for beneficial applications.",
