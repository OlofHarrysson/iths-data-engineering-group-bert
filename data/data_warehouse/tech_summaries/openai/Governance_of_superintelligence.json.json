    "title": "Governance of superintelligence",
    "summary": "AI systems are expected to surpass expert skill levels in most domains within the next decade, potentially leading to a future where superintelligence carries out as much productive activity as large corporations. The development of superintelligence poses both significant upsides and downsides, requiring careful risk management. Coordination among leading development efforts, international oversight, and technical research on safety are crucial. However, regulations should not hinder the development of less capable AI systems. Public input and oversight are necessary for the governance and deployment of powerful AI systems. Despite the risks, building superintelligence is seen as necessary for a better world and stopping its creation would be challenging.",
