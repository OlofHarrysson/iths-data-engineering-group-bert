    "title": "Using GPT-4 for content moderation",
    "summary": "Using GPT-4 for content moderation allows for faster iteration on policy changes, reducing the cycle from months to hours. GPT-4 can interpret and adapt to policy updates, resulting in more consistent labeling. This approach offers a positive vision for the future of digital platforms, where AI can assist in moderating online content and relieve the burden on human moderators. The process involves developing and customizing content policies, refining them through an iterative process, and deploying them at scale. The use of large language models like GPT-4 can lead to more consistent labels, a faster feedback loop, and reduced mental burden on human moderators. However, the judgments of language models are vulnerable to biases and need to be carefully monitored and refined by humans.",
