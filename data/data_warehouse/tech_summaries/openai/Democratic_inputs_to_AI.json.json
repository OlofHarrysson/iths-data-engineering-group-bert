    "summary": "OpenAI is launching a grant program to develop proof-of-concepts for a democratic process to determine the rules that AI systems should follow. The goal is to ensure that AI benefits all of humanity and is as inclusive as possible. The program encourages innovative approaches and envisions how AI can enhance the democratic process. The selected teams will receive a $100,000 grant to pilot their proposals and publish a public report on their findings. The program aims to complement government regulation of AI and address potential flaws in democratic processes.",
