    "summary": "OpenAI has extended support for the gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, gpt-4-0314, and gpt-4-32k-0314 models until at least June 13, 2024. They are working on improving newer models in areas such as instruction following, factual accuracy, and refusal behavior. They have introduced function calling capability in the Chat Completions API, updated versions of gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo, and a new 16k context version of gpt-3.5-turbo. They have also reduced the cost of their embeddings model and gpt-3.5-turbo's input tokens. Developers can provide feedback to help with the transition to the new models.",
