    "title": "Using GPT-4 for content moderation",
    "summary": "OpenAI is exploring the use of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 for content moderation. This approach allows for faster iteration on policy changes, reducing the cycle from months to hours. GPT-4 can interpret and adapt to policy updates, resulting in more consistent labeling. The use of AI-assisted moderation systems can relieve the mental burden on human moderators and offer a more positive future for digital platforms. OpenAI encourages Trust & Safety practitioners to try out this process for content moderation using the OpenAI API. However, it is important to monitor and refine the results to address biases and ensure accuracy.",
