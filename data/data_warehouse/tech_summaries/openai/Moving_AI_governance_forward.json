These commitments, coordinated by the White House, aim to advance effective AI governance globally. OpenAI commits to red-teaming models, sharing information on trust and safety risks, investing in cybersecurity, incentivizing third-party discovery of vulnerabilities, developing mechanisms to identify AI-generated content, publicly reporting model capabilities and limitations, prioritizing research on societal risks, and deploying AI systems to address societal challenges. These commitments will remain in effect until regulations covering similar issues are implemented.",
