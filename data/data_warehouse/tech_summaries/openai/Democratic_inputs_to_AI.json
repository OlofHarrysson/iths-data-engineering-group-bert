    "summary": "OpenAI has launched a grant program to develop proof-of-concepts for a democratic process that can determine the rules AI systems should follow. The program aims to ensure that decisions about AI behavior are shaped by diverse perspectives reflecting the public interest. OpenAI is seeking teams from around the world to participate in the program and develop innovative approaches to democratic decision-making in AI governance. The results of the studies will be freely accessible, and the program encourages best-effort, democratic-in-spirit processes involving deliberation and broad public input.",
