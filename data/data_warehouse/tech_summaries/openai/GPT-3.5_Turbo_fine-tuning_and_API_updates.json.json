    "title": "GPT-3.5 Turbo fine-tuning and API updates",
    "summary": "OpenAI has announced the availability of fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 Turbo, with fine-tuning for GPT-4 coming in the fall. This update allows developers to customize models for their specific use cases and run them at scale. Early tests have shown that a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 Turbo can match or even outperform base GPT-4 on certain tasks. The data sent in and out of the fine-tuning API is owned by the customer and not used by OpenAI or any other organization. Fine-tuning can improve steerability, reliable output formatting, and custom tone. It also enables businesses to shorten prompts and handle 4k tokens. Fine-tuning is most effective when combined with other techniques like prompt engineering and information retrieval. OpenAI will be introducing a fine-tuning UI in the future. Safety is a priority, and fine-tuning training data goes through a moderation system to detect unsafe content. The pricing for fine-tuning includes training costs and usage costs. OpenAI has also introduced updated GPT-3 models (babbage-002 and davinci-002) as replacements for the original models, and they can be fine-tuned using the new API endpoint. The pricing for base and fine-tuned GPT-3 models is provided.",
