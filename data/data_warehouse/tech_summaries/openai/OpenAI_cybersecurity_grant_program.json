    "summary": "OpenAI has launched a $1 million Cybersecurity Grant Program to enhance AI-powered cybersecurity capabilities and promote discussions on AI and cybersecurity. The program aims to empower defenders, measure the capabilities of AI models, and elevate discourse in the field. OpenAI is seeking project proposals that focus on practical applications of AI in defensive cybersecurity, such as data collection and labeling, social engineering detection, incident triage automation, and vulnerability patching. Offensive-security projects will not be considered for funding. OpenAI will grant funds in increments of $10,000 USD and give preference to projects that have a clear plan for public benefit and sharing.",
