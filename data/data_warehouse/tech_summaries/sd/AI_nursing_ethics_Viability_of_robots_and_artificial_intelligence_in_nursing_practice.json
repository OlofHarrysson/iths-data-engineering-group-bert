    "title": "AI nursing ethics: Viability of robots and artificial intelligence in nursing practice",
    "summary": "Researchers from Tokyo University of Science, The University of Tokyo, and Kyoritsu Women's University have explored whether robots and AI can be trusted with nursing tasks. They examined whether robots and AI can replicate the ethical concepts attributed to human nurses, such as advocacy, accountability, cooperation, and caring. The researchers expressed concerns about robots' ability to understand and empathize with patients' values and effectively navigate human relationships. They also highlighted the importance of conducting further investigations to determine the appropriate appearance of robots for efficient cooperation with human medical staff. While robots and AI have the potential to understand patients' emotions and provide appropriate care, patient acceptance is crucial. The researchers acknowledge that robots may not fully replace human nurses in the near future, but further research could lead to new discoveries in ethics.",
