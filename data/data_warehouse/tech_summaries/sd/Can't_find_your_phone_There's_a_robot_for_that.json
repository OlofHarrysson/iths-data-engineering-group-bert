    "title": "Can't find your phone? There's a robot for that",
    "summary": "Researchers have developed a companion robot with artificial intelligence that can track and remember the location of objects for individuals with dementia. The robot uses a camera and object-detection algorithm to detect and track specific objects, recording the time and date they enter or leave its view. Users can choose objects to be tracked and search for them using a smartphone app or computer. The system has shown high accuracy and could provide more independence for individuals with dementia. User studies will be conducted to further test the technology.",
