    "title": "A roadmap to help AI technologies speak African languages",
    "summary": "Limited AI tools for African languages are a concern for AI researcher Kathleen Siminyu. The Masakhane Research Foundation aims to address this issue by developing accessible AI tools for African languages. The team conducted interviews with key players involved in African language tool development and identified four central themes: the importance of African languages in cultural identity and societal participation, the need for support in African content creation, collaboration between linguistics and computer science, and the consideration of ethical practices in data collection and use. The team plans to expand the study and hopes their findings will guide the development of various language tools and preserve indigenous African languages.",
