    "title": "GPT-3 can reason about as well as a college student, psychologists report",
    "summary": "Artificial intelligence language model GPT-3 performs as well as college undergraduates on reasoning problems, according to research by UCLA psychologists. However, the study raises questions about whether GPT-3 is mimicking human reasoning or using a new cognitive process. GPT-3 performs well on some reasoning tasks but fails at others. The researchers also found that GPT-3 performs better than humans on SAT analogy questions. However, GPT-3 struggles with problems that require understanding physical space. The researchers hope to determine whether GPT-3 is truly thinking like a human or using a different approach.",
