    "title": "Chatgpt designs a robot",
    "summary": "Researchers from TU Delft and EPFL collaborated with ChatGPT to design a tomato-harvesting robot. ChatGPT provided valuable input during the conceptual and implementation phases, suggesting the most economically valuable crop to automate and design features like a silicone gripper and Dynamixel motor. The researchers found the collaboration positive but noted the shift in their role towards technical tasks. They also highlighted the risk of misinformation and bias in relying solely on AI input. The researchers will continue using the robot and exploring the autonomy of AI in designing robots.",
