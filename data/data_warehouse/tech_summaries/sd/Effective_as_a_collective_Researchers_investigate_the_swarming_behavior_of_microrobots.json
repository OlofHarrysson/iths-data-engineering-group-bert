    "title": "Effective as a collective: Researchers investigate the swarming behavior of microrobots",
    "summary": "Researchers at Mainz University have studied the collective behavior of small robots and found that a group of robots working together can carry out complex tasks more successfully than a single robot. The robots, which have elliptical forms and move like beetles, follow circular orbits with specific radii. The researchers observed that when the robots had variations in their orbits, they required less time to explore a space and began to undergo self-organized sorting. This collective behavior could be exploited for applications such as transporting loads. The study was funded by the Collaborative Research Center/TRR 146 and the conclusions were based on experiments and model computations.",
