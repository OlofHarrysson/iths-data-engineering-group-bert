    "title": "Bot inspired by baby turtles can swim under the sand",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of California San Diego have developed a robot that can travel through sand at a depth of 5 inches. The robot, inspired by sea turtle hatchlings, is equipped with force sensors to detect obstacles and can be controlled via WiFi. The team conducted extensive simulations and testing to develop a streamlined design and a shovel-shaped nose. The robot can detect obstacles above its body but not below or directly in front of it. The researchers plan to increase the robot's speed and enable it to burrow into sand. The work is supported by the Office of Naval Research.",
