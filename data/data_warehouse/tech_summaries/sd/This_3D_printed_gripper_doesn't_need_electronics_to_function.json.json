    "title": "This 3D printed gripper doesn't need electronics to function",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of California San Diego have developed a 3D-printed soft gripper that can pick up, hold, and release objects. The gripper is equipped with built-in gravity and touch sensors, allowing it to detect when it is holding an object and release it at the right time. The gripper can be used in various applications, including industrial manufacturing, food production, and research tasks. The researchers also developed a new 3D printing method that reduces leaks and defects in the printed piece.",
