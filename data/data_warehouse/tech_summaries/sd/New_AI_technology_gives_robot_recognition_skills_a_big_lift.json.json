    "title": "New AI technology gives robot recognition skills a big lift",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Texas at Dallas have developed a robotic system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help robots better identify and remember objects. The system allows the robot to push objects multiple times, collecting a sequence of images that enable the system to segment and recognize the objects. This approach is an improvement over previous methods that relied on a single push or grasp. The researchers' technology is designed to help robots detect a wide variety of objects and generalize their recognition abilities. The next step for the researchers is to improve other functions, such as planning and control. The research was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.",
