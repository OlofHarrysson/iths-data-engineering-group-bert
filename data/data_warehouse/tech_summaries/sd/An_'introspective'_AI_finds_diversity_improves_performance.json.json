    "title": "An 'introspective' AI finds diversity improves performance",
    "summary": "Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of choosing diversity over homogeneity in its neural network structure. By giving the AI the ability to modify the composition of its neural network, the researchers found that the AI consistently chose diversity as a way to improve its performance. The team tested the AI's accuracy and found that it was up to 10 times more accurate than conventional AI in solving complex problems. The research suggests that allowing AI to embrace diversity can enhance its ability to learn and solve problems efficiently.",
