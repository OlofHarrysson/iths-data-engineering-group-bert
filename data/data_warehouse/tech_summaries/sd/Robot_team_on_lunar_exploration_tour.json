    "title": "Robot team on lunar exploration tour",
    "summary": "Researchers from ETH Zurich have equipped legged robots with measuring and analysis instruments to explore unknown terrains. The robots were tested in Switzerland and at the European Space Resources Innovation Centre (ESRIC) in Luxembourg. The team used multiple robots to take on specialised tasks simultaneously and compensate for any failures. Two of the robots were specialists, with one mapping the terrain and classifying geology, and the other identifying rocks using a spectrometer and microscopy camera. The third robot was a generalist, able to perform both tasks with less precision. The researchers plan to make the robots more autonomous and combine different types of robots for future missions.",
