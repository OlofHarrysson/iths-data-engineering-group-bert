    "title": "Out with the life coach, in with the chatbot",
    "summary": "Chatbots have been found to be effective in improving physical activity, diet, and sleep, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by researchers at the University of South Australia. The study found that chatbots can increase daily steps, encourage the consumption of fruits and vegetables, and improve sleep duration and quality. These findings highlight the potential of artificial intelligence to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Text-based chatbots were found to be more effective than speech-based AI. However, a blended approach of chatbots and human coaching may be the most beneficial.",
