    "title": "Sharing chemical knowledge between human and machine",
    "summary": "Researchers have developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool called DECIMER that can translate chemical structural formulae into machine-readable code. The tool uses deep learning methods to identify and classify images of structural formulae, and then translates them into a code that can be uploaded into databases. The researchers trained the AI tool using existing machine-readable databases and have already seen interest from both researchers and companies. The goal is to make scientific information more accessible and usable for the global scientific community.",
