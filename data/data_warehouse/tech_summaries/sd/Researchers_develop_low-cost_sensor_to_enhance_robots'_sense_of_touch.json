    "title": "Researchers develop low-cost sensor to enhance robots' sense of touch",
    "summary": "Researchers at Queen Mary University of London have developed a lightweight, low-cost, and wireless sensor called L3 F-TOUCH that enhances the force sensing capabilities of robot hands and graspers. Unlike other sensors that estimate interaction forces through camera images, the L3 F-TOUCH measures forces directly, achieving higher accuracy. The sensor can measure an object's geometry and determine the forces needed to interact with it. This breakthrough could enable robots to have a sense of touch, making them more capable of handling objects and performing complex manipulation tasks.",
