    "title": "Revolutionary self-sensing electric artificial muscles",
    "summary": "Researchers from Queen Mary University of London have developed a new type of electric variable-stiffness artificial muscle with self-sensing capabilities. This technology has the potential to revolutionize soft robotics and medical applications. The artificial muscle seamlessly transitions between soft and hard states and can sense forces and deformations. It exhibits flexibility and stretchability similar to natural muscle and can withstand over 200% stretch. By applying different voltages, the muscle can rapidly adjust its stiffness, and it can monitor its deformation through resistance changes. The fabrication process is simple and reliable. The potential applications include aiding individuals with disabilities and facilitating muscle function restoration during rehabilitation training.",
