    "title": "Robots cause company profits to fall -- at least at first",
    "summary": "Robots have a U-shaped effect on profit margins, according to a study by researchers from the University of Cambridge. At low levels of adoption, robots have a negative impact on profit margins, but at higher levels of adoption, they can help increase profits. This U-shaped phenomenon is due to the relationship between reducing costs and developing new processes and products. Initially, companies adopt robots to decrease costs, but as adoption increases, robots can be used to innovate new products and increase revenue. The study analyzed industry data from the UK and 24 other European countries between 1995 and 2017. The researchers also conducted interviews with an American medical equipment manufacturer to understand their experiences with robot adoption. The findings suggest that companies should adapt their business models concurrently with robot adoption to reach the profitable side of the U-shaped curve more quickly. The research was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).",
