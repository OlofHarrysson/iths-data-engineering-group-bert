    "title": "Tiny, shape-shifting robot can squish itself into tight spaces",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder have developed a miniature robot called CLARI (Compliant Legged Articulated Robotic Insect) that can change its shape to navigate through tight spaces. The robot, which currently has four legs but can be customized with more, weighs less than a Ping Pong ball and can transform from a square shape to a long and slender form. The researchers envision CLARI being used in disaster response scenarios and exploring spaces that are inaccessible to humans. Future iterations of the robot will incorporate sensors and aim for greater flexibility and strength.",
