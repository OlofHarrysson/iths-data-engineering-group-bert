    "title": "Shining a light on neuromorphic computing",
    "summary": "A review article published in Nature Photonics discusses the potential of optical memristors, which are analogs of electronic memristors, in revolutionizing high-bandwidth neuromorphic computing, machine learning hardware, and artificial intelligence. The article highlights the current progress and potential applications of optical memristors but emphasizes the need for scalability in order to fully realize their benefits. The researchers are searching for a material or device that meets all the criteria for an ideal optical memristor in order to drive the field forward.",
