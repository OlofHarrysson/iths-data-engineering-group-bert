    "title": "Robotic glove that 'feels' lends a 'hand'  to relearn playing piano after a stroke",
    "summary": "Researchers from Florida Atlantic University have developed a robotic glove that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to improve hand dexterity for piano players who have suffered a stroke. The glove combines flexible tactile sensors, soft actuators, and AI to provide support and assistance in relearning and regaining motor abilities. The glove is able to \"feel\" the difference between correct and incorrect versions of a song and offers real-time feedback and adjustments to help users grasp the correct movement techniques. The glove was able to classify song variations with a high accuracy rate, demonstrating its potential to aid individuals with disabilities in relearning dexterous tasks. The glove was designed using 3D printing and can be customized to fit individual patients. The technology has been described as a gamechanger for individuals with reduced limb functionality.",
