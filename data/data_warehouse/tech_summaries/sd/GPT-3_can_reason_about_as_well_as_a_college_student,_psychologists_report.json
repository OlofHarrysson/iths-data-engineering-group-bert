    "title": "GPT-3 can reason about as well as a college student, psychologists report",
    "summary": "Research conducted by UCLA psychologists has found that OpenAI's language model GPT-3 performs at a similar level to college undergraduates when solving reasoning problems typically found on intelligence and standardized tests. However, the study raises the question of whether GPT-3 is mimicking human reasoning or using a fundamentally new cognitive process. The researchers note that while GPT-3 performs well on some tasks, it fails spectacularly on others. The study also compares GPT-3's performance to human scores on SAT analogy questions and finds that the AI outperforms the average human score. However, GPT-3 struggles with problems that require understanding physical space. The researchers hope to further explore the cognitive processes used by AI models to determine if they are truly thinking like humans or if they are using a different approach.",
