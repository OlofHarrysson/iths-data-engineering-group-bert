    "title": "Robot 'chef' learns to recreate recipes from watching food videos",
    "summary": "Researchers from the University of Cambridge have trained a robotic chef to learn and make simple salad recipes by watching videos. The robot was able to identify the recipe being prepared and even came up with a new recipe on its own. The use of video content as a source of data for automated food production could lead to easier and cheaper deployment of robot chefs. While commercial robot chefs currently lag behind humans in terms of skill, this research demonstrates the potential for robots to learn new recipes through observation, similar to humans.",
