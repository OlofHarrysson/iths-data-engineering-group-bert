    "title": "New superconducting diode could improve performance of quantum computers and artificial intelligence",
    "summary": "Researchers from the University of Minnesota have developed a superconducting diode that could potentially enhance the energy efficiency and processing capabilities of computers. The device, made using three Josephson junctions, allows for the control of its behavior through voltage. Unlike traditional diodes, this device can process multiple signal inputs, making it suitable for neuromorphic computing. The researchers used industry-friendly materials, making the device more compatible for industrial applications and potentially aiding in the development of quantum computers. The research was funded by the US Department of Energy, Microsoft Research, and the National Science Foundation.",
