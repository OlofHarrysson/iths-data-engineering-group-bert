    "title": "MethaneMapper is poised to solve the problem of underreported methane emissions",
    "summary": "Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have developed an artificial intelligence-powered tool called MethaneMapper to detect and trace real-time methane emissions. The tool uses hyperspectral imaging to gather data from various types of terrain, allowing it to differentiate methane from other hydrocarbons and identify the source of emissions. MethaneMapper has a performance accuracy of 91% and is currently operated using airplanes, but the researchers have ambitions to develop a satellite-enabled program for wider coverage. The goal is to make the tool accessible to a wide range of users through a web platform.",
