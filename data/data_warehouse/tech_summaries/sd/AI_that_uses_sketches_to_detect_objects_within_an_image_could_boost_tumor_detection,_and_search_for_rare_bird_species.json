    "title": "AI that uses sketches to detect objects within an image could boost tumor detection, and search for rare bird species",
    "summary": "The University of Surrey will present a sketch-based object detection tool at the CVPR conference. The tool allows users to sketch an object, and the AI will search for a matching object in an image while discounting other options. The tool has potential applications in medicine and wildlife conservation. The University of Surrey has a strong presence at the CVPR conference, with over 18 papers accepted. The university's Institute for People-Centred AI focuses on research that makes a positive impact on the world.",
