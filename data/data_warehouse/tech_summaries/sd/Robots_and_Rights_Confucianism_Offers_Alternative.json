    "title": "Robots and Rights: Confucianism Offers Alternative",
    "summary": "A researcher at Carnegie Mellon University argues that instead of granting rights to robots, they should be seen as \"rites bearers\" and assigned role obligations. This approach, inspired by Confucianism, promotes teamwork and harmony between humans and robots. The researcher suggests that treating robots respectfully is important because they are created in our image, and mistreating them degrades ourselves. The analysis also highlights that non-natural entities like corporations have legal rights, and animals have moral and legal status in many societies.",
