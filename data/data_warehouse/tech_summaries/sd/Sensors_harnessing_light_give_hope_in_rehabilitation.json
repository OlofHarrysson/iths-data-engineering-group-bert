    "title": "Sensors harnessing light give hope in rehabilitation",
    "summary": "Researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) have developed a sensor technology called computer vision-based optical strain (CVOS) that overcomes the limitations of conventional soft strain sensors. CVOS sensors use computer vision and optical sensors to analyze microscale optical patterns, enhancing durability and streamlining fabrication processes. These sensors can detect three-axial rotational movements and enable precise recognition of bodily motions through a single sensor. The researchers integrated an AI-based response correction algorithm to improve signal detection accuracy. The CVOS sensors have potential applications in various industries.",
