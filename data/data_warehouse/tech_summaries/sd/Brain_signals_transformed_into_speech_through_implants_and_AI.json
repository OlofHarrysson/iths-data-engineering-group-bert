    "title": "Brain signals transformed into speech through implants and AI",
    "summary": "Researchers at Radboud University's Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour and UMC Utrecht have made progress in developing a brain-computer interface that can infer what people are saying. The team used brain implants in patients with epilepsy to measure brain activity while participants spoke words out loud. They were then able to translate that brain activity into audible speech using advanced artificial intelligence models. The researchers hope to make this technology available to patients who are paralyzed and unable to communicate, giving them a voice again. However, there are still limitations and further research is needed.",
