    "title": "Researchers develop low-cost sensor to enhance robots' sense of touch",
    "summary": "Researchers have developed a new sensor, called L3 F-TOUCH, that enhances the force sensing capabilities of tactile sensors in robots. The lightweight, low-cost, and wireless sensor can measure an object's geometry and determine the forces needed to interact with it. Unlike other sensors that estimate interaction forces through camera images, the L3 F-TOUCH measures forces directly, achieving higher accuracy. This breakthrough could enable robots to have a sense of touch, making them more capable of handling objects and performing complex manipulation tasks.",
