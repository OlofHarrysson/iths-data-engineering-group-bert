    "summary": "Researchers from the University of California Irvine, Children's National Hospital, and Invitae Corporation have developed a chatbot called GIA to streamline the process of obtaining consent for medical research trials. The chatbot quizzes participants to assess their knowledge and can be accessed at any time, making it more convenient for individuals with limited free time. In a study involving 72 families, the researchers found that the chatbot reduced the length of the consent conversation and the time from referral to consent completion. Participants also reported a positive experience with the chatbot. The researchers believe that the chatbot can improve the process of obtaining informed consent and should be used in different languages to reach a global population.",
