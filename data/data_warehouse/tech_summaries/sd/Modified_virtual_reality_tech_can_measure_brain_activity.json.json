    "title": "Modified virtual reality tech can measure brain activity",
    "summary": "Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin have developed a noninvasive EEG sensor that can be integrated into a comfortable VR headset. The EEG measures the brain's electrical activity during VR interactions, allowing for better understanding of how the brain reacts to immersive environments. The researchers created a spongy electrode made of soft, conductive materials to overcome the limitations of existing EEG devices. The technology has potential applications in various fields, including anxiety treatment, aviation training, and human-robot interactions. The researchers have filed preliminary patent paperwork and are open to partnering with VR companies to incorporate the technology.",
