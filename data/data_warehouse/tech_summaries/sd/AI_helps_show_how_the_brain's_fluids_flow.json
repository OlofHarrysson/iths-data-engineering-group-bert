    "title": "AI helps show how the brain's fluids flow",
    "summary": "A multidisciplinary team of researchers from the University of Rochester has developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) technique to accurately measure fluid flow in the perivascular spaces surrounding cerebral blood vessels. These spaces play a crucial role in transporting fluids and removing waste from the brain. The AI technique combines existing 2D data with physics-informed neural networks to provide high-resolution measurements of the fluid flow. This research has the potential to improve our understanding of neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and strokes, which are linked to alterations in fluid flow. The study was supported by various research programs and initiatives.",
