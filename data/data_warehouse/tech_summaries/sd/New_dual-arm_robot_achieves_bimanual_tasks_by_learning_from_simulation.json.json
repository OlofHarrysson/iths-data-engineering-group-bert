    "title": "New dual-arm robot achieves bimanual tasks by learning from simulation",
    "summary": "Scientists at the University of Bristol have developed a system called Bi-Touch that allows robots to carry out manual tasks by sensing what to do from a digital helper. The system uses AI agents to interpret the environment through tactile and proprioceptive feedback, enabling precise sensing, gentle interaction, and effective object manipulation. This development could revolutionize industries such as fruit picking and domestic service, as well as potentially recreate touch in artificial limbs. The researchers used a virtual world to train the AI agents and successfully applied them to a real-world dual-arm robot system.",
