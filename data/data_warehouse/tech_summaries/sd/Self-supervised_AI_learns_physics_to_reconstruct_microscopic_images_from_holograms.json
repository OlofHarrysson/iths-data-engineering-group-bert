    "title": "Self-supervised AI learns physics to reconstruct microscopic images from holograms",
    "summary": "Researchers at UCLA have developed a self-supervised AI model called GedankenNet that learns from physics laws and thought experiments. The model was trained to reconstruct microscopic images using only artificial holograms created from \"imagination\" without relying on real-world experiments or data. GedankenNet successfully reconstructed microscopic images of human tissue samples and Pap smears, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen samples without prior information. The researchers believe this approach has the potential to develop physics-compatible and broadly generalizable neural network models for computational imaging tasks.",
