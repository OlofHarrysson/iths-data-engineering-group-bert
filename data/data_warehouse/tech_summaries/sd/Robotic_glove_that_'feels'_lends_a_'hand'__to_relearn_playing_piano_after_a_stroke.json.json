    "title": "Robotic glove that 'feels' lends a 'hand'  to relearn playing piano after a stroke",
    "summary": "Researchers from Florida Atlantic University have developed a robotic glove that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to improve hand dexterity in stroke patients. The glove combines flexible tactile sensors, soft actuators, and AI to provide support and assistance to individuals relearning motor abilities. The glove can \"feel\" the difference between correct and incorrect versions of a song played on the piano and offers real-time feedback and adjustments. The glove was found to have a classification accuracy of 97.13% with a human subject and 94.60% without. The technology has the potential to aid individuals with disabilities in relearning dexterous tasks.",
