    "title": "Pros and cons of ChatGPT plugin, Code Interpreter, in education, biology, health",
    "summary": "Code Interpreter, an artificial intelligence chatbot plugin, has been found to have some benefits for bioinformatics, but it still has limitations. While it makes coding more accessible and cost-effective for users without a science background, it lacks features specific to bioinformatics, such as internet access for downloading genome data and support for large files and parallel processing. The plugin does help minimize fictitious answers and provides a solution for citing sources through coding. Suggestions for upgrades include expanding storage capacity, supporting additional programming languages, and addressing privacy and security concerns. Despite its limitations, the plugin is still seen as a valuable tool for data visualization and learning in the field of bioinformatics.",
