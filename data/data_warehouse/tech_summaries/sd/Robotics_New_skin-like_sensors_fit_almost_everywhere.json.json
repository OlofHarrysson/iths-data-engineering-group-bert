    "title": "Robotics: New skin-like sensors fit almost everywhere",
    "summary": "Researchers from the Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI) have developed a soft, skin-like material that can be wrapped around objects to create customizable sensors. The sensors, made using a 3D printer, change their electrical resistance when squeezed or stretched, providing valuable data on interactions with objects. This technology has the potential to revolutionize industries such as robotics and prosthetics by enabling the creation of wireless and customizable sensor technology for arbitrary objects and machines.",
