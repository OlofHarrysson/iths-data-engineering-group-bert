    "title": "Sponge makes robotic device a soft touch",
    "summary": "Researchers have developed a silicone sponge-based device that can provide variable stiffness to robots, allowing them to handle delicate objects with a soft touch. The device can be mounted on the end of a robotic arm and is capable of stiffening or softening by squeezing the sponge. This inexpensive and lightweight solution has potential applications in industrial robots for gripping fragile substances and in service robots for safer human-robot interactions. The researchers plan to further enhance the device's capabilities, including achieving variable stiffness in multiple directions.",
