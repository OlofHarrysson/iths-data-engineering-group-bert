    "title": "Self-supervised AI learns physics to reconstruct microscopic images from holograms",
    "summary": "UCLA researchers have developed a self-supervised AI model called GedankenNet that learns from physics laws and thought experiments. Unlike existing AI models, GedankenNet does not require human supervision or pre-labeled datasets. Instead, it reconstructs microscopic images using random artificial holograms created solely from imagination. The model successfully reconstructed microscopic images of human tissue samples and Pap smears, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen samples without prior experimental data. The researchers believe this approach has the potential to develop physics-compatible and broadly generalizable neural network models for computational imaging tasks.",
