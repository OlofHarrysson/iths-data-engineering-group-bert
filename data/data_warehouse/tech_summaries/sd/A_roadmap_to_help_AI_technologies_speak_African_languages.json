    "title": "A roadmap to help AI technologies speak African languages",
    "summary": "African languages have limited AI tools, which is a problem that needs to be addressed. The Masakhane Research Foundation is working to develop accessible AI tools for African languages. The research team identified key players involved in developing these tools and found four central themes to consider: the impact of colonization, supporting African content creation, collaboration between linguistics and computer science, and ethical practices in data collection and use. The team plans to expand the study and address barriers to access. The goal is to develop a wide range of language tools and preserve indigenous African languages.",
