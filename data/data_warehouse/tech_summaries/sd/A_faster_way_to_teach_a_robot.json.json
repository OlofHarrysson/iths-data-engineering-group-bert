    "title": "A faster way to teach a robot",
    "summary": "Researchers at MIT, New York University, and the University of California at Berkeley have developed a framework that allows humans to teach robots more efficiently. The system generates counterfactual explanations when a robot fails, showing what needed to change for the robot to succeed. The human user provides feedback on why the robot failed, and the system uses this feedback to fine-tune the robot. The framework has been tested in simulations and has shown promising results in teaching robots faster and with less human effort. This could be a step towards enabling general-purpose robots to perform daily tasks for the elderly or individuals with disabilities.",
