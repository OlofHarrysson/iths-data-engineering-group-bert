    "title": "Robotics: New skin-like sensors fit almost everywhere",
    "summary": "Researchers from the Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI) at TUM have developed a soft, skin-like material that can be wrapped around objects to create customizable sensors. These sensors, made using a 3D printer, can detect changes in electrical resistance when squeezed or stretched, providing valuable data on interactions with objects. The integration of these soft sensors in 3D objects has the potential to revolutionize industries such as robotics and prosthetics by enabling wireless and customizable sensor technology.",
