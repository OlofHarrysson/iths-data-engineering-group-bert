    "title": "Ecology and artificial intelligence: Stronger together",
    "summary": "A recent paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences argues for a synergy between artificial intelligence (AI) and ecology. The authors suggest that AI can benefit from ecological principles to overcome challenges it currently faces, while AI can also contribute to solving complex global challenges in ecology. The paper highlights how AI can help ecology by analyzing large datasets, predicting disease transmission, and uncovering complex relationships. On the other hand, ecology can improve AI by inspiring more robust and adaptable architectures, addressing issues like mode collapse, and understanding emergent behaviors. The authors emphasize the need for closer collaboration between AI and ecology to achieve transformative perspectives and solutions.",
