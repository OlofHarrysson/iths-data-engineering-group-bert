    "title": "Ecology and artificial intelligence: Stronger together",
    "summary": "A recent paper argues for a synergy between AI and ecology to address global challenges such as disease outbreaks, biodiversity loss, and climate change. AI can help ecology by analyzing large datasets, predicting virus transmission, and uncovering complex relationships. On the other hand, ecological principles can improve AI by inspiring more robust architectures, addressing mode collapse, and understanding emergent behaviors. Closer collaboration between the two fields can lead to advances in resilience, social responsibility, and the integration of diverse knowledge systems. However, achieving convergence requires bridging disciplinary gaps and fostering conversations.",
