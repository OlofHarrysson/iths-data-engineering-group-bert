    "title": "New superconducting diode could improve performance of quantum computers and artificial intelligence",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a superconducting diode that could potentially enhance the energy efficiency and processing capabilities of computers. The device, made using three Josephson junctions, allows for the control of its behavior through voltage. Unlike typical diodes, this device can process multiple signal inputs, making it suitable for neuromorphic computing. The researchers believe that their device, which is compatible with any type of superconductor, could help scale up the development of quantum computers for wider use. The research was funded by the US Department of Energy, with partial support from Microsoft Research and the National Science Foundation.",
