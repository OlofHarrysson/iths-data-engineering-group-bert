    "title": "Allowing robots to explore on their own",
    "summary": "The Autonomous Exploration Research Team has developed robotic systems and planners that allow robots to autonomously explore and map unknown environments. The systems can be used in various applications, such as delivery and search-and-rescue. The team has combined sensors and algorithms to create efficient and accurate mapping systems that work in low-light and challenging conditions. Their exploration system was used in a competition and won an award for mapping more of the route than any other team. The team is open-sourcing their work to benefit society.",
