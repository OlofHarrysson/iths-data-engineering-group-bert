    "title": "Robot team on lunar exploration tour",
    "summary": "Researchers from ETH Zurich and other Swiss universities have equipped legged robots with measuring and analysis instruments to explore unknown terrains. The robots were tested on various terrains in Switzerland and at the European Space Resources Innovation Centre (ESRIC) in Luxembourg. The team used multiple robots to take on specialized tasks simultaneously and compensate for any failures. The robots were equipped with different instruments, with some focused on mapping and classifying terrain, while others were designed to identify rocks. The researchers plan to make the robots more autonomous in the future.",
