    "title": "Modified virtual reality tech can measure brain activity",
    "summary": "Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin have developed a noninvasive EEG sensor that can be integrated into a Meta VR headset. The EEG measures brain activity during VR experiences and could be used for various applications, such as helping people with anxiety or allowing humans to see through the eyes of a robot. The researchers created a spongy electrode that is more comfortable for users and overcomes the limitations of existing EEG devices. The technology will be used in a robot delivery network project and the researchers are open to partnering with VR companies to incorporate the technology into headsets.",
