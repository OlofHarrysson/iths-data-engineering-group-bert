    "title": "Bees make decisions better and faster than we do, for the things that matter to them",
    "summary": "Researchers have developed a model of decision-making in bees, shedding light on how their brains work and potentially informing the design of better robots. The study, led by Professor Andrew Barron from Macquarie University and Dr HaDi MaBouDi, Neville Dearden, and Professor James Marshall from the University of Sheffield, found that bees can make decisions faster and more accurately than humans, despite having a brain smaller than a sesame seed. The researchers trained bees to recognize different colored \"flower disks\" and observed their decision-making process. They then built a computer model that replicated the bees' decision-making process, which closely resembled the physical layout of a bee brain. The study suggests that bees use their flight movements to enhance their visual system and improve their ability to detect the best flowers. The researchers believe that AI researchers can learn from insects and other simple animals, as their brains have evolved to be highly efficient with low power requirements. This understanding could inspire the development of more advanced AI systems.",
