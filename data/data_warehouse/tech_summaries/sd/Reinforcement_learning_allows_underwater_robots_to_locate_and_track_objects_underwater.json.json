    "title": "Reinforcement learning allows underwater robots to locate and track objects underwater",
    "summary": "Underwater robotics is becoming increasingly important for exploring the oceans and gathering in-situ data to complement satellite data. A new study shows that reinforcement learning, commonly used in control and robotics, can be applied to underwater robots to optimize their actions and achieve specific goals. This technology enables the study of small-scale phenomena and the monitoring of oceanographic instruments in real-time. The researchers used range acoustic techniques and trained neural networks to improve the accuracy of locating objects underwater. The algorithms were tested on autonomous vehicles in experimental missions. Future research will explore more complex missions and multi-platform reinforcement learning techniques. The study was funded by the European Marie Curie Individual Fellowship and the BITER project.",
