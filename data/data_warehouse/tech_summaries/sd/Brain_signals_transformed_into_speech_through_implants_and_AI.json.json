    "title": "Brain signals transformed into speech through implants and AI",
    "summary": "Researchers at Radboud University's Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour and UMC Utrecht have made progress in developing a brain-computer interface that can infer what people are saying. By using brain implants in patients with epilepsy, the researchers were able to analyze brain activity and translate it into audible speech. The reconstructed speech sounded like the original speaker and was intelligible and understandable. However, there are still limitations, and further research and advancements in technology are needed to predict full sentences and paragraphs based on brain activity alone.",
