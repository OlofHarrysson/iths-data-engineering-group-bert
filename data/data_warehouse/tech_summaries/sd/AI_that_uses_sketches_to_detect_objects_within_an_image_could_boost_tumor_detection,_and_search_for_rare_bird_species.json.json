    "title": "AI that uses sketches to detect objects within an image could boost tumor detection, and search for rare bird species",
    "summary": "The University of Surrey will present a sketch-based object detection tool at the CVPR conference. The tool allows users to sketch an object, which the AI will use to search for a matching object in an image. The tool takes into account visual cues such as pose and structure, and can be used in various applications, including medicine and wildlife conservation. The University of Surrey is known for its research in AI and has a strong presence at the CVPR conference. The university's Institute for People-Centred AI focuses on research that addresses the technical, ethical, and governance aspects of AI.",
