    "title": "Robotic proxy brings remote users to life in real time",
    "summary": "Researchers at Cornell University have developed a mobile robot called ReMotion that can mirror the movements of a remote user in real-time. The robot is controlled by a device called NeckFace, which tracks the head and body movements of the user. In a small study, participants reported a better connection with their remote teammates when using ReMotion compared to other telerobotic systems. The researchers hope to further develop ReMotion for use in virtual collaborative environments, classrooms, and other educational settings. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Nakajima Foundation.",
