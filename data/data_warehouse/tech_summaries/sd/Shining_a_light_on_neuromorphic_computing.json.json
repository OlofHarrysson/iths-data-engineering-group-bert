    "title": "Shining a light on neuromorphic computing",
    "summary": "The article discusses the potential of optical memristors, which are analogs of electronic memristors, in revolutionizing high-bandwidth neuromorphic computing, machine learning hardware, and artificial intelligence. The review article provides an overview of recent progress in the field and highlights the applications of optical memristors. However, scalability is identified as a major challenge that needs to be addressed. The article also mentions the need for an ideal optical memristor that is compact, efficient, fast, and capable of changing optical properties significantly.",
