    "title": "Mori3: A polygon shape-shifting robot for space travel",
    "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed a modular robot called Mori3 that can morph from 2D triangles into various 3D shapes. The robot uses a process called polygon meshing to join triangular modules together, allowing it to change its size, shape, and function. The researchers believe that this modular and multi-functional design could be advantageous for space travel, where robots need to perform a wide range of tasks in limited space. The Mori3 robots could be used for communication and external repairs in spacecraft.",
