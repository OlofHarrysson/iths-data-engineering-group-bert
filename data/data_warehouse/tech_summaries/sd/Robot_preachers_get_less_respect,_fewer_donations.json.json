    "title": "Robot preachers get less respect, fewer donations",
    "summary": "Robots may not be able to fully replace religious leaders due to the need for credibility, according to a study conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago. The study involved experiments with humanoid robots delivering sermons in Buddhist and Taoist temples. Participants viewed the robot preachers as less credible and made smaller donations compared to those who heard sermons from human priests. The study suggests that while some people believe robots could be effective preachers, there are more who remain unconvinced. The findings may apply to other religions as well.",
