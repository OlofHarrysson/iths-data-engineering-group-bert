    "title": "AI helps show how the brain's fluids flow",
    "summary": "Researchers from the University of Rochester have developed a novel AI technique to accurately measure fluid flow in the perivascular spaces surrounding cerebral blood vessels. The team combined measurements from animal models with physics-informed neural networks to create high-resolution images of the fluid flow. This new method allows for a better understanding of the pressures, forces, and three-dimensional flow rate in the brain, which could have implications for neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and strokes. The research was supported by various funding programs.",
