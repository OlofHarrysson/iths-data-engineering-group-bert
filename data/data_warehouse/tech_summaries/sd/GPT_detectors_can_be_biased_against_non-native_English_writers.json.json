    "title": "GPT detectors can be biased against non-native English writers",
    "summary": "AI detectors used to identify AI-generated text, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are unreliable and can have significant consequences if used to review job applications, college essays, or high school assignments, warns Stanford University's James Zou. In a study, seven popular GPT detectors incorrectly labeled over half of non-native English speakers' essays as AI-generated, while correctly classifying over 90% of essays by US eighth-grade students. The detectors rely on text perplexity, penalizing essays with simpler word choices, making non-native English writers more vulnerable to being flagged as AI. The study highlights the need for caution and further improvement of GPT detectors.",
