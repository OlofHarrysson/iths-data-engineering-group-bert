    "title": "Robot preachers get less respect, fewer donations",
    "summary": "A study conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago found that humanoid robots delivering religious sermons are viewed as less credible and receive smaller donations compared to human religious leaders. The study involved experiments at a Buddhist temple in Japan and a Taoist temple in Singapore, as well as an online experiment with Christian participants in the United States. The findings suggest that while some people believe robots could be effective preachers, the majority are not convinced and prefer human leaders who can demonstrate faith. The researchers believe these findings could apply to other religions as well.",
