    "title": "Bot inspired by baby turtles can swim under the sand",
    "summary": "Researchers at the University of California San Diego have developed a robot that can travel through sand at a depth of 5 inches. Equipped with force sensors, the robot can detect obstacles while in motion and can be controlled via WiFi. The team drew inspiration from sea turtle hatchlings to design the robot's flipper-like appendages. The robot's design includes terrafoils on its nose to control lift and maintain level depth in the sand. Future goals include increasing the robot's speed and enabling it to burrow into sand. The research was supported by the Office of Naval Research.",
