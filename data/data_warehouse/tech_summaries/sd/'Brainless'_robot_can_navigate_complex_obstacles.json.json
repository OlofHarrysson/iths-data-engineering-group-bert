    "title": "'Brainless' robot can navigate complex obstacles",
    "summary": "Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed a new soft robot that is capable of navigating twisty mazes and moving obstacles without the need for computer guidance. The robot is made of ribbon-like liquid crystal elastomers and uses physical intelligence, meaning its behavior is governed by its structural design and materials. The asymmetrical design of the robot allows it to turn without making contact with objects, preventing it from getting stuck between parallel obstacles. The researchers demonstrated the robot's ability to navigate complex mazes and fit through narrow spaces. The development of this robot could have applications in soft robot design and energy harvesting.",
